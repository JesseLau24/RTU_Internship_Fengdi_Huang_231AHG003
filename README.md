# RTU_Internship_Fengdi_Huang_231AHG003
This is an internship project...... Nothing to look at......

It contains 2 parts. First is a web crawler for scraping all the posts on Zhihu on certain topics, then it would be used to find out the key topics the users were focusing on in order to understand the market dynamics.

Second part is labeling the user comments with local deployed LLMs. The csv files contains the classified users' info, which the files I would not share, but the code for utilzing local LLMs to label the texts are written by me, so they would be shared here. (I would use some demo files to demostrate it here)
