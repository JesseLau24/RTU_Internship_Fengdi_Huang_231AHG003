# RTU_Internship_Fengdi_Huang_231AHG003
This is an internship project...... Nothing to look at......

It contains 2 parts. First is about market research on social media. I was assigned to investigate Zhihu.
I use a web crawler for scraping all the posts on Zhihu on certain topics, then it would be used to find out the key topics the users were focusing on in order to understand the market dynamics.

Second part is labeling the user comments with local deployed LLMs. The csv files contains the classified users' info, which the files I would not share, but the code for utilzing local LLMs to label the texts are written by me, so they would be shared here. (I would use some demo files to demostrate it here).

# This Github repo is purely for demostrating the code for Internship presentation purpose. All files are mock files for demostration. It doesn't contain any information that is classified.

# All code were written by me (with built-in automation tools such as Gemini, Co-Pilot), therefore, sharing the code does not harm the interst of the company.
