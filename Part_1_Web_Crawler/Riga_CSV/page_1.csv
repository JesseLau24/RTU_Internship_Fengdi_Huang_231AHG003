1kifoac,hooyaxwell,"**Cocktail bars** ‚Äî *Barents Cocktail and Seafood Bar* is a very cool spot. Not exactly cheap, but definitely worth it. I‚Äôd recommend making a reservation in advance.  If you‚Äôre into more hipster vibes, check out:  * **Labietis** ‚Äî Local craft beer in a cozy setting, both indoors and outdoors. * **Tallinas kvartƒÅls** ‚Äî Not a single venue, but a whole block with various places around a square ‚Äî bars, clubs, coffee spots (probably 5‚Äì7 in total). It‚Äôs close to Labietis, so you can easily explore both in one evening.  The surroundings are a bit shady-looking compared to Old Town or Elizabetes Street, but still quite safe:  * **Alus R≈´me Trofeja** * **Laska V21**  Speaking of Elizabetes Street ‚Äî if you‚Äôre into good wine, *definitely* try **Noble Wine**.

Also I‚Äôm not saying that the whole country is run down, but there is an overall feeling of it being really old and kind of crumbling and empty. Sometimes i drive through villages that are just abandoned.  The emigration started with the 2008 recession and hasnt really ceased. I think a huge portion of our population leaves the country each year, and it is predicted that Latvia is going to reach under 1 million inhabitants by the end of the century (its currently around 1,9 million).   Most people go to the UK, but also a lot of other places in Europe such as Germany, Poland and Iceland, and quite a few to Scandinavia. Theres not a lot of social support from the government and the jobs are scarce and wages are poor. It‚Äôs quite hard sometimes to make a living so many people plan to move out the country and return later (and then never do). I lived in the UK for most of my life but very frequently visit my homeland, and perhaps will move back one day, but most likely not. The opportunities provided in other countries are huge, and Latvia just doesnt have those resources or chances. The universities arent the best and the education system is a bit wobbly (i did go to school there for a few years in my early teens). Also a lot of things are closing down, like hospitals and schools. All this means that Latvia is just slowly disappearing sadly",2,1746513545.0,2025-05-06 06:39:05

In the last 10 years, average salaries have gone up by 120% (more than doubled). Adjusted for prices, in the last 10 years GDP per capita has doubled.   Adjusted for PPP, Latvia's GDP per capita is only about 20% lower than Japan or New Zealand. It is 30% lower than the UK. So yes, it is poorer - but not really very dramatically so.   Countryside is empty and getting emptier. Most young people don't really have much interest in agricultural jobs, and Latvia is not capable of subsidizing agriculture to the same level as Western Europe. It is also a pretty large country with low population density - 50% larger than Switzerland or The Netherlands, so it is not always possible to commute to work.

Also, an old shipwreck (""Lady Cotlin"") that can be seen from the beach. Mangalsala is quite popular with locals, but I doubt that many tourists have time to visit it.¬†   Likewise, Vakarbuƒºƒºi &amp; Daugavgriva offers a beach, an old fortress and a sculpture park by the Lielupe river. They have 20+ big art objects made by a local artist just standing by the river.¬†   If you go to Mezciems, you can visit the Motor museum (they have a good collection of antique cars), and next to it is a race track, which is open to public. When no races are taking place, you can freely walk the whole track, and many locals use it for jogging and cycling. To make things more interesting, the track is actually located next to a forest with a lake in the middle of it.

We aged them while walking around Riga.  For drinks with a view checkout the food court top floor and balcony of Galerija Centrs (it‚Äôs a shopping mall but has a bar and food hall with good decent priced pizza and a rooftop view) alternatively the skyline bar at the radisson blue conference + spa. They also have a football themed cocktail right now and do have a dj on Saturday nights (at least that‚Äôs when we went)   For a pastry the basque Cheesecake in Mikkla Bakery.  For a activity you can walk along Bastejkalna Park and do the canal tour as you suggested or one we saw a lot of people doing is cycling drinking tours. They have a table and a guide who steers but we saw a lot of these.  I would also say Riga is a beautiful city with amazing parks, if your going for that and not cheap alchohol just walk around and enjoy it. It truly is stunning and amazing how extensive the old town is.
