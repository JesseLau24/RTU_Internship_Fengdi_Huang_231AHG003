1fqiupn,arthorse,"Cheap is great of course. Just know that you will very likely not see the sun. As for snow, it depends on the severity of the winter.   You can search for the websites lieliska davana and davanu serviss for activities around Riga. You can buy a gift card there or go to the business‚Äô website to see if they have availability. Other than that, keep exploring Google maps for interesting things especially around old town.   Check out Lido. And there‚Äôs also a panorama view of the city on the Latvijas ZinƒÅt≈Üu akadƒìmija. Not sure if it‚Äôs available then, but you can search for it. Tickets must be paid in cash and as of two years ago they were 5 euro I think.   We have a botanical garden as well. If the greenhouses are running then, it could be nice. We also have huge malls, so that‚Äôs another thing to check out. Ooh and definitely help yourself to the hot drink vending machines that are around.   Plenty to do and see. Just keep looking for things and you‚Äôll find stuff you really like.",4,1727427677.0,2024-09-27 09:01:17

1fjb65d,marijaenchantix,"Google? Look at post history? I'm pretty sure these questions get answered here on the regular.  Your line about ""meeting girls"", however, is disrespectful and shows what you're really after, despite saying you're not. Latvian women are too smart for you. Someone who openly admits he wants to ""meet women because they're beautiful"", is usually giving off the creep vibe and we can smell that from a mile away. Don't. Do. It. Plus, you're here for 2 days. Latvians aren't like you, we don't just talk to strangers or become friends immediately. Shows how little you understand of the mindset. Latvians don't throw around their friendship or company, and if you try to approach anyone, they will probably see you as a creep. To us, it's not worth talking to you if you leave the next day.",1,1726902662.0,2024-09-21 07:11:02
1fjb65d,o_eRviNNhaS,"Hi u/marijaenchantix  Thank you for your kind post, recommendations and guidance. Very useful and very welcoming.  Now, a bit more seriously:  I've been googling Riga and what to do for a while, was looking more for personal experiences, rather than a guide for masses. We can all do that, but if you're after more unique experiences and hidden gems that not always are mentioned on mainstream city guides, you come here, and ask.  Like I did in the last 31 countries I visited. And up to date, still hold contact with many of those I met on my way, socializing as described above.  You were definitely rude, judgmental, and unpleasant by the way you addressed to me.  I'm not really after anything more than what I wrote, so please stop creating monsters in your attic, they don't exist. I'm a very outgoing person, I socialize very easily everywhere in the world. Talking and approaching people, in this planet was never hard or unpleasant to me. I'm a peoples person, like to talk and get to know the language, habits, food culture and so on. Therefore, unless the Latvians you describe are really from another planet, I don't see any difficulty or barrier preventing this from happening. And the ones I work with, and worked in the past, are way different from the picture you describe. You know, it's quite a lot of Latvians living here in Norway...  **I'm sorry if you had negative experiences in the past and come here projecting what happened to you before.**  As I said, I'm only after a good time, exploring the city, the food and a bit of the nightlife. If I am able to meet people and have a good chat, even better, if not, life goes on.  You give a very negative and chauvinist perspective of Latvia and its population by generalizing a snobbish way of welcoming and treating tourists. Keep that in mind.",1,1726923025.0,2024-09-21 12:50:25
1fjb65d,marijaenchantix,"Riga is a small city. There isn't much to hide, and almost everything is ""for the masses"", since there aren't that many people anyway.      Where was I rude and judgemental? I informed you of the general attitude which you seem to not understand. I understand you are from a warm country with extroverted locals, but you are not everyone, and it is very rare that someone from here would immediately jump to the opportunity to be your friend or have a one night stand with you. We just don't do that. I don't know how familiar you are with more northern cultures, but clearly you need to familiarise yourself with it and the way to talk to people. There is nothing snobbish about the fact you clearly lack the understanding of how people communicate in other countries. Not everyone will welcome you with open arms like your country does. In fact, we don't like to be approached by strangers, we don't like loud or overly chatty people. Which is what you seem to be. I gave you a fair warning that you may need to tone it down.

1fbglxw,AndreyMoreAggr3ssive,"In the city centre, try Kozy Eats on Blauma≈Üa Street. It's vegan food and hipster place, but I'm sure you're gonna be impressed by quality and prices.  On Lienes Street you'll find Nurme Brewery, which has a cool vibe. A bit further there is a decent burger place (OAK'a Burger) and next to it another place - Karbonades. Worth checking the menu online, maybe it's up your alley. But, foods deffo worth it.  Nurme Brewery is nearby Tallinas KvartƒÅls somebody mentioned in another comment.  You can stop for a coffee at Ziedondarzs there is a cafe there (Paviljons Ziedondarzs), nice views, nice chill atmosphere.   Maybe there is something going on in Andrejsala during your visit. There are a few restaurants - Koya, Mute.Riga. Check the menu, if it suits your budget.   Near Kronvalda Park there are a few places for food - particularly, around the corner of Dzirnavu iela &amp; Antonijas iela. Good menu, good quality food. However, this is more upper class.   It's deffo worth to try LIDO for lunch after a night of partying. ""Traditional Latvian comfort food"" (baked potato, various kinds of meats, fish, pancakes with mushroom filling, etc.)   I don't know much about art and culture - modern art exhibitions you'll find in galleries in old Riga are quite amateurish level. Might be interesting to see for comparison, if you're involved in the field, but will leave you unsatisfied, if you're just a casual enthusiast.  Art space Kim? (on Sporta street, nearby Andrejsala &amp; Kronvalda Park) sometimes has some good stuff going on, usually, which provokes thought. Check online in advance - https://kim.lv/en/[https://kim.lv/en/](https://kim.lv/en/)  Museum of Occupation might offer something different from things you'd see elsewhere. With the things going on in Ukraine, these guys have been experiencing occasional hate crime against them.  If you're willing to travel, I would recommend a day trip outside Riga - first, Lƒ´gatnes Bunkurs (a soviet nuclear shelter) and afterwards a bus ride to Cƒìsis before heading back to Riga.  The Old Town is worth passing by and walking through for views.
