134ow5m,_gAyJ_,"""Stockmann"" is for the most part more expensive than other stores, as it mostly sells items that are hard to find in other stores in Latvia - 'luxury' brands, import items, etc. The same ,mostly, applies to ""Sky&amp;More"".  * An office chair / gaming chair. - Possibly ""Jysk"" or ""220.lv"", ""Rd Electronics"", but there are most certainly stores with better prices. * Home stuff like a chest of drawers, office and kitchen supplies like storage boxes, moka pot for coffee, etc. - ""Cenuklubs"", ""Jysk"", ""1a.lv"", ""220.lv"", some of the items can also be found at ""Kurši"" for good prices. * Electronics, like a computer monitor, kitchen and bathroom scales - ""RD Electronics"" or some 'tech' store in ""Alfa"", ""Domina""(or another big shopping mall) for the monitor. ""Cenuklubs"" would most likely have the scales at lower cost. The online stores ""220.lv"", ""1a.lv"" also have all these items. * Garden stuff (little vegetable and fruit plants, and seeds) - ""Depo"" is probably the easiest, but you'd probably find the items cheaper at small non-chain stores.  ""kurpikt.lv"" and ""salidzini.lv"" are good resources for price comparison and finding the cheapest option, but I'd suggest always checking the reviews for the stores before purchasing anything.

12t332e,Unlikely_Author_607,"Hey there! Navigating the rental market in Riga can indeed be a bit tricky, especially for a shorter stay like 8 months. Sorry to hear about the bad advice from your institution.   Local Websites: Start with ss.com and City24.lv. They're quite popular for rentals in Riga and offer a variety of options. Just remember to filter for short-term rentals.   Facebook Groups: Check out groups like Riga Apartments/Houses for Rent and Sale. While it's always good to be cautious (especially in groups where anyone can post), you can often find good leads. Pay attention to posts from verified agents for more security.   Pinecone Property Group: If you're looking for something more tailored to international students, Pinecone Property Group might be a good option. They're known for helping students and expats find suitable accommodations in Riga and might have options that align with your 8-month stay.   University Networks: Sometimes other students or university boards can have leads on available rentals. It's worth checking out any online forums or networks related to your institution.   Remember to always check the terms of the lease, especially for the duration of your stay, and if possible, have a local or someone familiar with the Latvian rental market review any contracts before you sign. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your time in Riga!",1,1705334701.0,2024-01-15 16:05:01
