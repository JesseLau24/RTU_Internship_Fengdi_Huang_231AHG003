118w2zm,Available-Safe5143,"I am not an expert in this, but I'd suggest going to a cigar lounge. 1. t's called Oak Lounge, they are affordable, tourist-friendly, yet the place looks a bit posh. You can make a seat reservation, to make sure you all fit in. 2. There is an AC Marriott bar just across the street. 3.There is a beer bar with a huge choice of beer from all around the world, the place is called MyBeer. They often have live music on Fridays. 4. You can play pool/billiard in Pepsi Centrs. Better to call them to make a booking. They are located in a short walk from the Old Town.  For more, you can try asking in r/Latvia community , it is a much bigger community of people. I do not recommend ""the famous"" overrated bars and clubs, such as rockcafe. People just get drunk there, dance, but there is no value in such places.",2,1677137186.0,2023-02-23 07:26:26
118w2zm,Available-Safe5143,"Please note. If you go to a place where usual Latvians go (meaning, not a tourist trap), you wouldn't be paying a lot. The places I mentioned cost half less than what I'd pay in the UK.     If you wish to go out to a restaurant for Latvian middle class people, definitely do it. It will also cost you half of what you'd spend in UK. I personally go to GanBei and LondonGrill often. However, please note, do not expect Anglophone kind of hospitality. Hospitality in Latvia is more similar to one in Germany or Scandinavia. It's not rubbish, but , it's less than what Americans or Brits would expect.",2,1677137743.0,2023-02-23 07:35:43

1119wb4,AccidentalScumbag,"You should be entitled to a ""pamatkonts"".   Lemme research a little bit.  edit: In short, it's an EU thing to avoid creating unbanked populations and reduce money laundering and terrorist financing risks. More information here:   https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/bank-accounts-eu/index_en.htm  From a quick skim of bank's websites and a couple of articles, it looks like it's a service banks REALLY don't like to provide, but are required to for compliance reasons. They can only refuse that for very specific reasons, as per the law. So there's precious little information available on the bank's website.   Here's some relevant links to information provided by the main retail banks in Latvia. Making a branch appointment might get you further than dealing with customer service remotely. Also, send an email to FKTK to stir some trouble and rock the boat.
