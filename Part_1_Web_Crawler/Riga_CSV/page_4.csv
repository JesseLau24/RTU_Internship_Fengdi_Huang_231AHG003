Latvians are initially very reserved towards strangers.   2 months is like the time it would take them to start letting you in their circle and barely start seeing you as friend.

Once in a while there's a more specific exhibition dedicated to this topic, but I haven't heard of anything recently. Our pagan traditions are still intertwined with more modern ones, though. For example, the way we celebrate Easter is mostly pagan.  You might find the Open Air Museum on the outskirts of Riga interesting. The buildings there are just a couple hundred years old, but people's lifestyles back then definitely included many pagan aspects and beliefs. They sometimes host events that are based on our folk traditions, especially around equinoxes and solstices.  If my memory serves me well then the exhibitions at Turaida Castle (outside Riga, but a good day trip) also include quite a bit of information about our early history.

1jb84cc,001Piffi,"Cheapest way is by Bus, costs 1.50 per person. Taxi alternatives available with Bolt, usually around 8-10€ (use code BOLTLOCAL or LOCALBOLT for 50% discount on one ride).   You don't need to buy tickets in advance for the Tower but a couple weeks ago it was closed and I'm not 100% sure if it's open right now. To Skyline Bar you can just go. It's not the greatest bar and expect hotel bar prices (which are high compared to other bars Riga but not ridicilous). You can also just go up there with the elevator and enjoy the view from the toilet if you don't want to buy a drink at the bar. That also works.",3,1741973050.0,2025-03-14 17:24:10

1jb3sum,Disastrous_Prior7288,"Hi. We have legend/joke if the city is complete, it will sink in the river, so it had to be built constantly. And so it has been built since the 12th. century. Furthermore, over time, half a Europe has been here claiming ownership (Swedes, Poles, Russians, but Germans most of the time) and adding something to the urban landscape. Each time, the new ""owner"" just added something in their own image. On top of that, as the city grows, incorporating surrounding villages existing ""street plan"" also was included. And again, as the next governance comes, they just built on top that was already there. As for the soviet times, they mostly added living blocks (blocky, creepy looking buildings) closer to the outskirts of modern Riga. Well, basically, everything that looks like that was built in that time.  As for the central part of the city, they made worse already unnatural looking street plan, by adding new building in between what was already there and changing the significance of the road. So previously, small, innocent, walkable street/road became driveway.   In the end, 8 centuries and many builders were needed to give you experience that you had.",2,1741962845.0,2025-03-14 14:34:05

I'd say it is the most entertaining rivalry.
