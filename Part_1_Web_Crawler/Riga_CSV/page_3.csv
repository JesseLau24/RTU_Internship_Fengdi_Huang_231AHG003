1jztuec,Leading-Ad-3340,Find some Riga related chats in telegram. Subscribe to riga.lv Instagram. Sometimes there is info about events in Riga on the street. Sometimes googling Riga events what to do gives you results. Come to blabla club on tuesday at 19.30,2,1744827537.0,2025-04-16 18:18:57

1jztuec,Tall_Stick5608,"Try a gun range, this doesn‚Äôt exist or is t easily accessible in many other European countries. I discovered a hidden talent first time I tried one.  Book yourself into one of the 5 star hotels in the city , off season and weekday and you can make use of the pool, sauna, steam room, gym, amazing bed / breakfast for a fraction of what it will cost in an expensive city like London.  There are quite a few vintage clothing shops worth browsing and talking to the staff, most are younger people who interact with foreigners.  The weather is getting nicer to take a bus to Sigulda and ride the cable car or take a train to Jurmula and go for a walk on the beach. There are loads of parks / forests in and around the city.  Admire some Soviet architecture and take some cool photographs, post them on social media with tags to Riga. Great way to meet people over a hobby.  I think the hardest thing to do in Riga is making friends / interacting with locals but I‚Äôve actually had success on apps like Couchsurfing where there are more open minded people. btw I don‚Äôt live in Riga. My girlfriend does and I visit once a month and have been doing so for the last 2 years.  https://preview.redd.it/yxypd1328ave1.png?width=1534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba7a666c5888ac7556b70f9679ef950770aa5715",3,1744846469.0,2025-04-16 23:34:29

1jztuec,Tall_Stick5608,Grand Poet by Samrah. If you book in advance in the off season you get a room with breakfast for about 90 euros. What I do is order the breakfast to my room for a further 7 euros after using the spa / swimming pool and gym.

1jz2wxb,Beningtonkk,"From having traveled to USA, UK, other European countries, I can say that in Latvia I've always received the best healthcare. I have a heart condition and the medical expertise here is very high, yes the staff can be overworked asf, but the quality is very good, and it costs fraction of what other countries ask.

1jz2wxb,Actually_Late,"It's a mix but there are definitely some good options with high quality doctors. For Latvians that usually means that you have to pay more but since you are probably not covered by our social security anyway, it probably doesn't matter. There was a website that specifically had a lot of the good clinics that are foreigner friendly, I've been to some of them and they were good.

1jz2wxb,xdox123,"If you have money then it will fine. If it involves government then in some cases waiting lines can take months (but that most likely is for specific and more difficult health conditions). Also a lot depends on each individual family doctor. Some care about clients, but others better to avoid. Look for reviews about specific doctors. Also check what doctors can speak English or language you know. Otherwise you might need to hire translator. In general quality itself is good and modern.",3,1744672964.0,2025-04-14 23:22:44
1jz2wxb,Suspicious-Coconut38,"It is and it isn't good, it depends. You have to use your own critical thinking sometimes :) Here healthcare is not for free(or at least, not 100% of it, there are some procedures/surgeries that are for free if you want to wait, but that is another story), so in some way it is a business.   When in Scandinavia, etc, your family doctor will tell you to take a painkiller and go home(also not great), here the doctor will prescribe you **multiple** medicine and tests. Your choice to buy them or do the tests.  It is very common to have a health insurance as one of the benefits if you will be working, which usually covers quite a lot, so you can go to any private doctors you wish to and have it covered.  So... it depends I guess on your needs, critical thinking, etc.",4,1744655186.0,2025-04-14 18:26:26

1jz2wxb,shustrik,"Very uneven, I would say. If you find a doctor in a private clinic that works well for you and your healthcare situation, it‚Äôll in all likelihood all work great. If you end up in the state system (e.g. private hospitals have very narrow specializations on elective stuff, for most serious emergencies you‚Äôll end up at a state one), it‚Äôs a coin flip.

1jz2wxb,Vladekk,"Balance of quality and price is good. If you are younger/healthier or have less money, Latvian healthcare is not bad at all.   If you have money, there might be countries with better equipment and doctors. Also, if you have rare or complex condition, it might be that Latvia has no expertise for that.  There is no utopia. My sister lives in USA, and recently clinic told her boyfriend the closest date they can do some examination on him is NEXT YEAR.  And this is with expensive insurance and connections in medical field! (he works in medical startup and often speaks with officials in state medical department).

1jy0nfl,Tall_Stick5608,"Unfortunately stuff happens but just look at it as a memory, when we travel some good and some bad all are memories.   My Latvian gf and I had a cheap evening flight on our anniversary a year ago from a remote airport in Belgium back to Riga. She absolutely had to make the flight as she had work the next day. We missed our connecting train to the airport and were stuck in the middle of nowhere with no Uber or even a phone number for a local taxi. I asked some local teenagers to call me a taxi and paid 110 euros to get to the airport, flight was delayed and we got to Riga after midnight with no bolt / bus operating and had to use the extortionate taxi drivers outside the airport :) stressful and expensive at the time but memorable and we laugh about it now.   On another occasion we fell asleep in our hotel in Budapest at 3am despite having a 7am flight back to London. We got a taxi who broke all the speed limits and we got to the airport at 6.30am just about boarding the plane.   But on the other hand we had a multi continent trip once with about 9 flights each and each and every one of them was on time and things went according to plan.",1,1744689694.0,2025-04-15 04:01:34

Decaf there costs extra, but you order what you want, how you want (they use scale to measure espresso perfectly) go and pick it up when ready, no need to even struggle with explaining staff about decaff.    App is called 'COFYZ app me in'.  Best bumble coffee in Riga too. Skip on their coconut milk though.    Another local option Cafeinn may have (if they're not suddenly out...) is chicory coffee.

1jw1om3,Morterius,"As a parent with two kids the same age, depends on your kids :D¬†   If they're patient, some museums would work, like the Museum of History and Navigation, Museum of the History of Natural Sciences and, if you want to scare them, the museum of medicine and anatomics (only if you're a goth family). If they're into cars, the Riga Motor Museum is very good, even though it's not in the center. It's one of the very few ones that's really interactive.¬†   For local cuisine, I would still suggest Lido chain, even though some locals would cringe probably, because it's buffet style and kids can pick whatever they want and you can try unusual things, there's one with a windmill¬† and kids playground, but it's a bit outside of the center (Lido Krasta), but in the center as well.¬†   Register with bolt taxi if you can (local Uber) , since you're 4, it's better anyways for short trips and not that much more expensive, since you have to buy tickets for 4, it will save you a lot of hassle.¬†   If the weather holds, I would suggest to go to¬† city of Jurmala by train to see the seaside (Majori station), there's the Jomas street for restaurants and you might be able to dip your toes in the sea, also some beach playgrounds and the ""J≈´rmalas Ma≈æaparks"" park with tree climbing activities). There's also an Aquapark in Jurmala (Bulduri station) if your kids are very into swimming and dissapointed if it rains.¬†   It's generally very safe, especially if you're with the kids and don't go to bars looking for trouble.¬†   A common scam is the taxis at the airport, they have to display their tariffs openly, just check if they're not insane and don't follow anyone that offers a taxi. I would take just the salad green Airbaltic taxis at the exit just to be on the safe side.¬†   Other than that, you're set, I hope you will enjoy your time in Latvia!¬†",13,1744303945.0,2025-04-10 16:52:25

1jw1om3,JournalistShoddy2760," Which dates are you travelling? There's kids and youth song and dance festival happening in Riga around July 5-13 (nacgavilet.lv for more info). So around that time the city might be more crowded with other kids and families.  For rainy days - most shopping malls have some sort of kids activities areas (for a fee though). Check out Skypark in Domina mall. There's also Jump Space in Spice, Adventica in Olympia, and some others. Usually only the kids need to buy the hourly or daily pass and parents can just sit and relax on the side.   If you find it difficult to fill all the 6 days in Riga, you might consider a day trip or even an overnight stay at some other city. Ventspils - a coastal city around 2.5h drive from Riga - has a nice science centre Zinooo, there's also a kids park/playground area in the city, indoor and outdoor pools/slides (udensparks.lv and pludmalesakvaparks.lv). Cesis has a cool older castle and is generally a nice city (can be reached by train as well).",1,1744447534.0,2025-04-12 08:45:34

And nights weren‚Äôt cold, being near the sea.  I didn‚Äôt know much and chose a newer apartment in ƒÄgenskalns, across the river from Centrs and the old town. It was extremely peaceful, very green and mostly residential with pretty wooden houses and gardens.   I prefer to walk rather than take public transport, so walking to Centrs was around 40 minutes. By tram or bus it was 15-20 min. I ended up not going there much, so I feel I missed a bit being in the city itself.   My apartment was more than ok for me, working remotely, with very good internet for my video calls, and I paid 750 euros/month on Airbnb.  I enjoyed my summer in Latvia, but for me it was mostly getting out of the city, exploring other towns and a bit of the Baltic. Forest walks, the never ending beach and the countryside.   I didn‚Äôt have much social contact, cause I‚Äôm that way, but I also felt locals weren‚Äôt that open, which is ok for me.

For a few months Airbnb might still be your best choice, though. Be upfront about bringing a dog.   Before choosing the part of the city where you want to live, consider your priorities. The city centre is very walkable and you'll be close to many bars and restaurants, but some streets might be loud with outdoor terraces for restaurants etc. There are some parks in the city centre, but there are other parts of the city with forests near/in them which might be great for your dog.

1js7ha8,kristapszs,"Summers are awesome in Latvia, your clothing will be fine. Considering that you have dog, i would avoid center, simply because there is almost no greenery (atleast considering my standarts) I always feel sorry for the dogs who need to do their business on the pavement. And center  gets too hot in the summers. I know that USA hot places air conditioning is a basic feature, but here air conditioning is a luxury in apartaments and only few has it, so consider it as well. Also air quality is not the best in center. I would suggest more greener palces like Mezciems (it has Bikernieku mezs next to it, best place for walks) or Mezaparks (if ur budget allows it, mezaparks is expensive and argubly the fanciest neigborhood of Riga, but avoid Sarkandaugava which is next to it) ,  those are a bit further away from center but still well connected.  Then its Grizinkalns, Skanste (also on expensive side) or Teika. I have bias about right side of Daugava and i think its way better than the left side of Daugava river(with exception of Agenskalns), but otherwise , right side is more developed and more things to do, with more parties/events, better food etc. with better opportunities outside the city as well.  Riga has a train connections to both sides of the sea (Jurmala on one side, and Saulkrasti on the other). Also visit Gaujas National Park (another + for right side of Daugava river).
