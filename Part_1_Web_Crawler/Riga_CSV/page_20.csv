For more curated vintage stores, try Northern Grip and Pop Life Vintage.   Generally, I would not recommend ""OtrƒÅ elpa"" because clothing is overpriced and kinda blah. You can often find good books there though, especially at the Stabu street location. But for books and coffee, Robert's Books might be a more interesting choice.  For coffee, try local roasters like Kalve or Rocket Bean, they're good. There are nice bakeries like Mƒ´kla, K≈´re, Muffins &amp; More, Bul's Bakery. Stay away from Caffeine, unless you want a sugary milk drink with a few drops of coffee in it.  If you want an interesting vibe, there's Art Cafe Sienna.",2,1722578235.0,2024-08-02 05:57:15

1ehbnq9,SummerySunflower,"Happy to help! There are regular Humana stores too but they mostly sell fast fashion, Humana Vintage has clothes from the 90s and earlier. You can check humanalatvia.lv to see what prices you can expect, they have a rolling schedule. At full price the items can be quite pricey (up to 20-25 euros per piece) but the price is gradually lowered until everything is 50 cents. In my experience, the sweet spot is the stretch between -50% and 4 euros an item.",1,1722590872.0,2024-08-02 09:27:52
1ehbnq9,VnotTori,"Depends on what you want... My cousin and I went to Humana vintage (it's slightly more expensive compared to other Humana thrifts, but the items are actually going to be vintage. Got a really cool heart necklace for 12‚Ç¨ with a large metal pendant) - pretty cool atmosphere and you can have a sip of coffee right there if only one of you is into shopping (it's completely free for customers and right next to the entrance).   If you want a cheap, yet interesting experience, I would recommend going to Caffeine and ordering "" es nezinu ko es gribu"" -the bartender decides themselves what coffee they want to give you, you only get to decide weather it's hot or cold. I got an M size and paid about 3,30‚Ç¨, got a big cup of delicious cinnamon coffee!   If you want to drink coffee more lavishly, I cannot recommend Costa coffee at Stockmann enough! They have absolutely delicious seasonal drinks and imo overpriced, yet delicious cakes.  If you want a more authentic experience-Lido is your way to go! They are scattered across Rƒ´ga and you'll find more Latvian tasting food there! Not sure how the prices are now, but it's a bistro, so probably pretty good compared to other places.   And Hooligan bubble tea for extra points - a pretty good boba joint if you like that, but avoid ordering matcha at all costs (it tastes like fish and I had to throw mine away!)  If I were you, I would check out the DGS thrifts in Riga as well, not sure if those have any vintage but I personally love them. If it has a DGS premium, you might be able to find brand new brand-name clothing pieces.   Check out OtrƒÅ elpa too - the clothes are the least interesting part, although you may find some designer items for cheap. They have a lot of books, trinkets and other cool stuff as well as old Latvian magazines.  Not that familiar with bakeries in Rƒ´ga, but you might look up ""MƒÅrti≈Üa beƒ∑ereja"" as an option... Haven't been there myself but I've seen the sign countless times.  Hope this helps and good luck on your trip!",2,1722587923.0,2024-08-02 08:38:43

1edq02u,Illustrious_Load_728,"Alr.  First of all ‚Äúyou see what you want to see‚Äù works both ways, you know.  Second thing - depends on occupation. For example, in my surroundings and field I‚Äôm in, 3 out of 10 people left to study, came back after they got master‚Äôs and doctorate (Switzerland, Norway, Germany) and stayed. One left.  (Belgium). Everyone else either stayed to study and eventually work here or did Erasmus, but didn‚Äôt go to study full time. Living happy life and so do I. Also, ‚Äúevery second family‚Äù? Yeah, source is that you made that up?   Third thing - of course no one will stay in small 7k town, lol, what do you expect? As if in other countries everyone born and raised in a small town and/or village where nothing is going on/they can‚Äôt find their calling/whatever other reason to move to a bigger city will stay there and not move to a bigger city, while visiting on holidays. Yeah, that‚Äôs a Latvia-exclusive, surely.  Fourth thing, did those that went to find happiness actually found it or they still work 3 jobs to pay off the student loans, insanely priced appartments and groceries? You know that qualified specialist‚Äôs salaries are exponentially larger or smaller depending on a country they live in? Yeah. Also, ‚Äúthey work and live in poverty‚Äù, what are they doing? Mopping the streets? Working as a postman in a village? There are shitty jobs that pay shit, but they are shitty jobs all around the globe, if you can‚Äôt do a well paid job, cos you are not qualified to - you won‚Äôt be paid well anywhere, lmao, and you will still work and live in poverty.  Fifth thing, ‚Äúrose tinted glasses‚Äù is not my thing. There are A WHOLE LOT OF things that are falling behind a lot of bigger countries, though they are improving gradually, things are not as bad as they were 10 years ago. Latvia is not the worst country in the EU by any margin and it‚Äôs doing just fine especially if you consider the fact that it was being staled and regressed by a russki-pussi occupation for what, 50 years? Yeah.",1,1722270218.0,2024-07-29 16:23:38
1edq02u,Clear-Substance-8031,"First off, sure, perceptions matter, but let‚Äôs not forget facts and data. Latvia's demographic and economic challenges are pretty well-documented, not just based on personal stories.  Second, about people leaving for studies and jobs - while some do come back, the bigger picture shows a lot more people leaving than returning. Eurostat data even shows Latvia has one of the highest emigration rates in the EU. Many young professionals leave and don‚Äôt come back, leading to brain drain and workforce shortages.  Third, rural depopulation isn‚Äôt just a Latvia thing, but it hits us harder. Rural areas here are aging fast and losing people, leading to school and business closures. This just makes things worse over time, and compared to other European countries, Latvia faces these issues more intensely.  Fourth, about life abroad - many Latvians move because they find better job opportunities and higher wages, even if living costs and student loans are high. Studies show that emigrants generally end up better off economically compared to staying in Latvia.  Fifth, sure, low-paid jobs exist everywhere, but in Latvia, the issue is worse because of limited opportunities and lower average wages compared to Western Europe. This pushes people to look for better prospects abroad, where even lower-skilled jobs offer better pay and conditions.  Lastly, about the USSR, let‚Äôs be real. During the USSR era, Latvia got significant investments, infrastructure, and support. It was a prestigious place to live, with plenty of resources and opportunities. Now, the current ruins and abandoned places are a stark contrast to that time. The issues today aren‚Äôt because of the past occupation; they‚Äôre because Latvia hasn‚Äôt effectively transitioned and used its potential post-independence. We let pride guide us into a crisis, refusing to trade with Russia even though it could be profitable",0,1722276751.0,2024-07-29 18:12:31
1edq02u,Illustrious_Load_728,"I agree on a lot of things you say, I‚Äôll just add something to consider.   USSR: yes, they invested heavily, however they were a heavily sanctioned country, technologically behind Western world for like 30 years at minimum.  Wages: yes, they are higher in Western Europe. As are prices. On everything.  Statistics: yes. However, they don‚Äôt paint the exact picture. Latvia isn‚Äôt dead, however looking at stats you‚Äôd think that it‚Äôs only babu≈°kas and a few infants. (Over exaggerated, but you got it, I hope)  People leaving: well, that‚Äôs a loop. People started leaving because things were not good in early 2000s. Latvia couldn‚Äôt get much better, because they left and didn‚Äôt pay any taxes. People left, because Latvia couldn‚Äôt get much better, because people left and didn‚Äôt pay any taxes. Latvia coul‚Ä¶ Yeah. And that affects rural areas and whatnot.    Also, the fucking ‚Äúvissslikti‚Äù mindset. Fuck me. Leaving, crying on reddit, doing nothing, but ‚Äúvissslikti‚Äù.  Otherwise, you are kinda right.",1,1722279071.0,2024-07-29 18:51:11
1edq02u,Clear-Substance-8031,"Hey man, I appreciate that you see some reason in what I‚Äôve said, even though many Latvians might not agree. I understand that we‚Äôre all proud of our country and want it to succeed, but there are facts we need to face to move forward.  One key point is that the USSR isn‚Äôt and never was the main issue. While many blame the Soviet government for Latvia‚Äôs current state, it‚Äôs not entirely accurate. The USSR dissolved over 30 years ago. Since then, many other European nations, including our Baltic neighbors and Poland, have adapted and improved. Latvia, however, has struggled to catch up. Claiming that the USSR was technologically 30 years behind is also misleading. The USSR was a major global player, involved in significant technological advancements and the space race.  Regarding statistics, I mentioned that around 1.5 million Latvians are officially counted as living in Latvia. However, this number is inflated since many, including myself, still maintain a residence or have a GP here but live abroad. This overestimation skews the real picture of the population.  As for the migration loop, you‚Äôre right‚Äîthere‚Äôs a cycle where people leave because conditions are tough, which in turn hinders improvement due to a reduced tax base. Many Latvians aspire to see their country thrive but often choose to leave for better opportunities elsewhere. In Western Europe, despite higher living costs, the opportunities for higher wages make a significant difference. For example, a factory worker in the UK can earn close to ¬£2,000 a month, which is multiple times the salary in Latvia. With a partner working as well, they can lead a comfortable life, unlike in Latvia where low-skilled jobs don‚Äôt offer the same financial stability.  Regarding the ‚Äúvissslikti‚Äù mindset, it‚Äôs important to understand the frustration behind it. When people consistently face challenges and see little improvement, it's natural to complain. Many Latvians want to be proud of their country, but the lack of unity and opportunities often drives them to seek a better life elsewhere. Until Latvia can offer better prospects and a unified vision for the future, this trend is likely to continue",1,1722282008.0,2024-07-29 19:40:08
1edq02u,Illustrious_Load_728,"It‚Äôs nice to have a conversation :D  Few things again. USSR was and wasn‚Äôt technologically behind. Sure, they participated and in the space and nuclear races, but uhh, so did the USA? While having actually comfortable cars that they did‚Ä¶ By themselves? And all the other different little things? See, the point I‚Äôm getting at is, yeah, USSR wasn‚Äôt that far behind, but it‚Äôs this little thing about the capitalism - competitiveness, where everyone is trying to get better than their neighbour/friend/name it, by developing something new, better and whatnot. I don‚Äôt think that unbiased fella would ever pick, say, RAF over uhhh, dunno, some nice big family wagon with A/C? Or Volga 21 over Caddy DeVille? Or Radiotehnika over Pioneer? Or Siemens over RVR ER-2? Nah. Sure, maybe the rockets were better, but in the end, Latvia had nothing to offer to the freshly opened gigantic capitalist market. That was more the point of me pointing fingers to the big bad Soviet Onion.  So with all of that ALONGSIDE with greedy and bumfuck stupid political and private decisions we do get what we get, yes.

However, I still don‚Äôt know where do you find those happy faces, that moved from Riga to say, Colchester or even worse, somewhere in US, found the lowest paying job and are happier than they ever would be if they lived the same way in here. Maybe the stories sound happy, but I highly doubt that a lowest paid worker is living in a 3 bedroom flat with a garage, AC and driving his Bmw 530d to the factory, somehow. More like 15 m2 room with a shared shower. Which is most likely the same. Depends on the field people are in, though, I‚Äôm more educated on my field and my own personal experiences on working abroad in different conditions.   Regarding the visslikti again. I don‚Äôt really see the reasoning behind the frustration though, because It‚Äôs funny to see the demographic of ‚Äúvissslikti‚Äù crowd. It‚Äôs MOSTLY either the ones that left somewhere in the early 2000s and are still shitting their home just to validate their decisions; or the ones that actually don‚Äôt do shit (whether it‚Äôs about their own life or about their service to the country) and are just yapping. Oh, and the ‚ÄúA VOT V SAVECKAM SAJUZE VOT PUTEN RASIJA MALADCI‚Äù crowd, but, well, fuck em. Although, there are some topics that it‚Äôs collectively okay to cry about and I won‚Äôt say a single thing about that. Roads, for example, fucking hell. Also, yeah. All the Baltic brothers did it better, which is a good example to look at and get better. Which is happening. Not as fast as everyone in Delfi comments would like it to happen, but it is.  Bottom line of my whole rant is this: 1) there are happy people in Latvia 2) not everything is complete and absolute shit 3) just saying visslikti doesn‚Äôt help 4) leaving doesn‚Äôt help 5) if we want the country/city/village/your own house to be better we must do it ourselves, no one‚Äôs gonna magically appear and make Latvia or whatnot suddenly great  Have a nice one ‚úåÔ∏è",1,1722290745.0,2024-07-29 22:05:45
1edq02u,dreamrpg,"Lets not forget that prior to occupation Latvia did very well. And economic, demographic challenges are largely caused by ussr distorting production, ethnic composition and values.   For instance many ""investments"" were of wrong type and in wrong places. Ineffective factories in places that do not have capacity to operate without force feeding workers.   Those wrong places made a need for roads, beidges nobody needed without those useless factories.   And demographics, guess what happened when in 90s you could be punched into face just because you speak language? That efectively cut potential partnership by third at least.   And what happened in 90s? Every post ussr country was fucked so bad that nobody had spare for kids.   And today of course it is not ussr fault anymore, but it played a role in 90s, and huge one.

In all those places, and in many other shops in Riga that sell wine, you can find a small selection, mostly in the 7-15 ‚Ç¨ range, and almost exclusively bottled by large companies.  Depending on what sort of wine you were drinking in Georgia, this may, or may not, satisfy you.

This slightly confusing establishment consists of two restaurants ( one Georgian, one Mediterranean ) and the Georgian wine shop / cellar, which is pretty much hidden away in the basement  ;-) )  They have literally hundreds of references, which you can buy in the shop or try in the very good Georgian restaurant there.  The quality of the wine there is far beyond anything you will find in the supermarkets ‚Ä¶ but, be warned, so are the prices.

You should be covered by going to the private clinic mentioned above and they will recommend the correct meds or supplements based on your specific symptoms but I just wanted to mention (in case you visit the pharmacy yourself) that supplements tend to come in much lower doses here than in the US which is usually good but for zinc specifically, you might want to mention what it's for or ask for a higher dose tablet than the daily use ones they usually give out. They also have vit c/magnesium/zinc combination dissolvable tablets like Emergen-C in the US. Aptieka also has pseudoephedrine prescription-free (Actifed or Daleron Cold3 which has paracetomol included) but they typically only recommend that for short-term use here not in case of an infection.",4,1721756203.0,2024-07-23 17:36:43
