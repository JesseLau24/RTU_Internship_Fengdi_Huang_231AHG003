The local neighborhood crowd it attracts doesn't help with this either.  Go to Lido Vērmanītis. It's way more central and has been recently renovated.",4,1671050969.0,2022-12-14 20:49:29

zlutwk,WilliamKurland,"Do NOT go to Lido except the biggest LIDO on the Daugava river edge in Kengarags, the others are small, crowded cafeterias with no proper toilet facilities.  The big LIDO is the largest wooden restaurant in the World.  Start out in the underground area, beer, Latvian cheeses and fish starters, wines, vodka.  Then, move upstairs for dinner.

Winter shoes would be great, I would actually take the chance to buy souvenir in the form of a new pair. 😅 Along the Daugava (river) should be clean to run with normal shoes.

z594zo,running-forward,Some of the previous places I've visited in winter (Krakow &amp; Tallinn for example) they cleared and salted/sanded the paths which made running in my usual running shoes possible with only the occasional icy patch.
