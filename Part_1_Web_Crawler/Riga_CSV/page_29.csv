1888ycv,LuneLune,"Recently looked to answer similar query, found that in addition to Games Shop there are also something available in [https://www.brain-games.lv/collections/meroga-modeli-games-workshop](https://www.brain-games.lv/collections/meroga-modeli-games-workshop) and [https://videogames.lv/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=113](https://videogames.lv/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=113)      Not sure which choice of marketplace is best though.",2,1701446997.0,2023-12-01 16:09:57

1814cxb,narrative_device,"The [Riga Christmas Market](https://livingwiththewolf.co.uk/a-guide-to-rigas-christmas-markets/) will be open. And Bastejkalns Park usually looks quite lovely in the evenings during the winter months. It's definitely a beautiful city to spend some time in, in the run up to Christmas.   You'll find plenty of cosy cafés, restaurants and bars in Vecriga to warm up in. Have a good trip!",5,1700664362.0,2023-11-22 14:46:02

1814cxb,holly_dev_ill,"1)The Riga winter market will be set up.  2)HIGHLY recommend walking in all the little streets of the old town because you never know what gems you're gonna find.   3)Always look up, in Vecrīga houses are beautifully decorated. Quest: Find the boy reading a book, a black cat, a wolf, bees and frogs. All of them are on separate buildings.  4) If you want some more traditional Latvian food (or food that's cooked and you can see them cook it) go to Lido.",1,1700757081.0,2023-11-23 16:31:21
