1h52yeb,apromurok,"Hi! I'm glad you made this decision!  If I understood well, you stay for three weeks, then I would consider visiting Vilnius or Tallinn or even both. They are a bit more than 4 hours by bus, so maybe one day would be too short, but if you find a cheap accommodation, two days might be enough for some impressions. And ta-da, your Rƒ´ga-trip just like that became a whole Baltic-exploration. But if you don't want to travel this much, then you can still visit places in the countryside of Latvia, as others mentioned. If you like hiking and being in nature, don't miss ƒ∂emeri and Piej≈´ra nature parks (both are by the sea), J≈´rmala, Sigulda, Cƒìsis, Valmiera, etc... Rƒ´ga, and all the Baltics are very safe, you don't really need to worry about that. In general it's indeed a bit hard to make friends with Latvians, they don't usually start conversations with strangers, but in your case, it also means no (or less) pushy men in bars, which is actually nice. One of my favourite places is M√∂ku bar, you might have even conversations there, but I've only met nice people there, really. They also have events e.g. bingo, karaoke, open mic. There's also a nice jazz club called M/Darbnƒ´ca and another great bar, Ka≈Üepes Kult≈´ras Centrs. Visit the central market of course, try smoked salmon, pirogi and anything you like. There's another nice market called ƒÄgenskalns, in the basement you'll find a second-hand store too. If you like museums, check Zuzeum or National Museum of Art. If you like (classical) music, try to find a choir concert, Latvia has an amazing choir culture, and they are really good at it. The National Library also worths a visit, it's free, you can look around, go up to the viewing point, and they usually have some small exhibitions. Go to an ice hockey match if you're interested! A sauna might be also a good choice in this cold. Have fun and enjoy your time!

Something tells me this is just a way to get rid of even more shop employees; which is why today most cashier-manned checkouts are empty. The self-checkouts started it, and they're at least somewhat useful, if there's a long queue at the regular checkouts. Though, there's usually a damn queue at the self-checkout too, esp. at peak hours.   This ""scan yourself"" thing would be much more useful, if you could scan your products with your phone (as you can already), and then ""check-out"" and pay within the shop app. Eliminating the need to use shop scanners and terminals altogether.
