1b44ivg,PickledWaffle,About the 2nd point I think it is against the law even if contract says otherwise. You can break the contract.  A common thing here is that the renter will try to keep the security deposit in case of breaking the contract before the term. But I think this was illegal as well if you gave a proper 1 month heads up,3,1709364476.0,2024-03-02 07:27:56
