1izx0bh,Difficult_Piano_6808,"Some or them, but not all university clubs or activities are limited to university students.  But what I meant is that you will find a lot of social opportunities around student life.  Example - students love going to Cartel pub, it starts late afternoon and is always just a huge gathering. Same with places like Funny Fox and Rock Cafe later at night. Or Tallinnas kvartals in summer or warmer months. If you like sports, sport bars like Kiwi bat fills with students around big games.   There is quite a lot of students that play paddle and tennis for example and there are some running clubs. And people go to the gym and climbing gym.   Same with international churches - many students and activities for young people.   It is probably not the best suggestion but apps like Bumble is also a place to meet people.",1,1741035223.0,2025-03-03 20:53:43

1ivzpnp,Ok_Corgi4225,"Presumably, you should do the same diet as before, do not  know from where you come, but should be achievable for comer from western or mediterranean countries. Not exactly low budget, though.  For bread - any high quality rye bread you like. We use ƒ∂elmƒìni brand, available at Rimi.  For sugar - replacement tablets.    You can also google up for local diabetic support groups and ask for advice if you have some specific situation.",1,1740289636.0,2025-02-23 05:47:16

Latvian rye bread tends to be on the sweeter side overall (compared with, for example, Estonian).
