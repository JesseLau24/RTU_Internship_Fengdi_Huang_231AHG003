1ezmvo5,arthorse,"Old town (Vecrīga) has some historical museums and lots of history. There are a few artsy things like the opera house and some malls have small art galleries. (Mols especially)  The Latvian Academy of Sciences is a very tall building and you can take an elevator to the top and see the whole city. Bring cash for buying the tickets.   Of course there are other historical things like the old KGB building, the Freedom Monument, the war museum, five of the nine Zeppelin hangars remaining in the world, etc. I highly recommend watching videos online of historical Riga. So much history in there and you can see old Riga and how similar it is today.  As for food, here is my advice. For reference, my palate is American. There is some amazing food here and locals might recommend things like pankukas and biezpiens. Biezpiens is essentially a dryer cottage cheese. I can do cottage cheese, but I can’t do biezpiens. Pankukas often contain biezpiens.  Lidot is a great place to for experiencing Latvian culture. There are several locations around Riga with some bigger than others. Their meats are amazing and everything else as well.  Additionally, pop into Rimi for some pastries and a glimpse of our products. They have a lot of souvenirs—especially the Rimi in Old Town. We also have hot drink machines around the city.   Try to avoid chains like McDonalds. You’ve probably had them before and they’re exactly the same. If you want something sorta similar but much better, have some Kebabs at one of the many Kebab restaurants.   Visit malls around Riga, especially if you’re feeling homesick. Malls are quite young places and so they tend to have more English things. Origo is lovely especially for train-watching. The second floor of the newer section will bring you outside to the platforms. Or you can go through the older part where the train station terminal is. When at Origo, keep to yourself and watch your belongings. Don’t let yourself get distracted by anyone either.   There’s a ton of stuff to do here like ElectroKarting, Ice skating, and spa stuff. Just search Lieliska Davana for listings of various activities. No need to buy a gift card, just navigate to their website. You can also go to Google Maps and explore the various places.  Trams are fun and there is also a hop on hop of sightseeing bus. It’s bright red and has two levels. You can find many parks here as well and even boat tours.  Sigulda (a nearby city) is outside of Riga but it has a ton of history. Jurmala is another city outside of Riga and that’s where you’ll find the beach.   Hope that helps :)",3,1724624611.0,2024-08-25 22:23:31

1ezmvo5,3lzaa,"For history occupation museum. For art- National museum of art. If you want to try local food, then go to Lido. But there are a lot of amazing places to eat in city center. I would recommend not to eat in Old town. Walk a lot in the streets of Riga and enjoy the Art Nouveau architecture, specially Alberta street. There is also Art Nouveau museum in Riga. I wouldn’t recommend taking pastries from rimi or other big chain stores, it’s much better to eat dough products in designated cafes, of which there are many in Riga.   If you want to go out of the capital city, then I suggest to go to Sigulda, Cēsis, Kuldīga, Ķemeru purvs at sunset/sunrise. You can go there by renting a car from Bolt or by bus or some of the places by train. But also feel free to use Rigas Satiksme in city center.",2,1724710993.0,2024-08-26 22:23:13

Let me pitch it for you: It's a private medical collection of a very successful doctor, turned into an amazing museum. While you walk trough the floors, you will experience the history of medicine from prehistoric to medieval, renesanse to modern times. It even has a room dedicated to Soviet space exploration.

1eyqpu1,Crazy-Age1423,"During first half of 20th century and before that Jugla was the SPA/resort part of the city (at least Jugla that is around the lakes) and then when Soviets took over it became a very mundane place to house workers. During the 90s it had a bad reputation for thiefs (just like a lot of other parts of Rīga), but in the last 20 years it has become much, much nicer.  Pros: - The bike trail from Jugla to VEF. If you work somewhere in between, it is amazing to be able to use a bike without any worries. - The 1st tram, as mentioned. You can get to the center without any problems within 25mins. - Akropole Alfa is a 20min walk away. If you don't need the big shops, you have small Rimi and Maxima within 5min walking. A bigger rimi in Jugla Center within 10mins. - Since I can roughly imagine where you are living (I've lived around there for around 30 years now), that is a NICE area, full of families and old people. - Every bus that goes out of town that way stops at the Jugla bus stop. So if you want to go somewhere in Vidzeme, it's very simple. - There's a nice kebab place that opened a year ago not far from you :D  Cons: - The woods are dirty and at the moment being thinned out, so they are full of machines. Unfortunately, you mighy see some drunks there and around it that are relicts of the old era. Just need to wait them out, because sooner or later they will die out, but meanwhile at least in my experience they have always kept to themselves... *hoping*  - Traffic on Brīvība street at certain times, but if you don't drive a car, it will not impact you at all.

1evsaip,SunDyu,"I'm local. The issue with ADHD meds in Latvia is that officially ADHD is not recognized as a condition adults can be diagnosed with. It needs to be done since childhood.   In my case, overall I spent 7 years visiting various psychiatrists and doctors, stating clear evidence and suspicion towards ADHD - most of them blamed anxiety and depression, which was a symptom. When I was fed up with it, I aggressively pressed my psychiatrist who admitted there is not one person in the whole clinic (Veldre) who can test me for this.  Went to a private specialist who diagnosed me within 15 minutes and explained the horror of our system. i.e. an adult cannot be diagnosed with ADHD in Latvia through official, state-funded channels. There is no mechanism for this. Yes, it is as insane as it sounds. I was very close to going to Bez Tabu about this bullshit.",1,1724148084.0,2024-08-20 10:01:24

Generally, in my experience, doctors more subscribe to the "" just quit"" mindset.   You are a foreigner, so getting a controlled substance would likely be very difficult for you, if you can even find a doctor who speaks English and would be willing to give you this. They have no way to know if you aren't just asking for drugs and will disappear or something.   No, a GP is not allowed to prescribe such controlled substances and most doctors don't want to get involved with it as it requires regular control of you, and since you are a foreigner and who knows what you are doing here, they can't know that you will show up. Especially since oyu have proven that you can't even arrange these things on time for yourself.   Same goes for your ADHD meds. I think only a narcologist or psychiatrist can give you ADHD meds, but they will probably have to diagnose you again, your past paperwork doesn't apply here as each country has different regulations. If you take meds, why are you blaming your ADHD for procrastinating?      Regarding staying here, you know that you can't stay for more than 90 days without leaving, right?

It's weird to have issues at night though, I wouldn't think wasps are nocturnal.   At any rate you've got to locate the wasp nest in your vicinity and get rid of it. Otherwise it won't end.

1es6vxl,Krishjanis,"Many of these have already been mentioned, but my 2 cents: - Max Cekot: I think the most high-end option in Riga. You can go with the food menu only, I think it’s below 200€ per person, and get a couple drinks separately instead of the wine/juice menu - Snatch: Italian food with a twist, but it’s tasty. The steak is great, and so is the cheesecake, which I’d say is one of the most authentic you can find in Riga - Italissimo: nice Italian place, no crazy innovations, just good food and service. If you have kids there’s a playground on the basement floor  - Riviera: same owners as italissimo, Mediterranean cuisine, really nice, but still good price/performance in my eyes.  All of the above will require booking in advance tho, you’ll be incredibly lucky to get a table at the last minute.",1,1723969739.0,2024-08-18 08:28:59
