15ue0jx,[deleted],"Can‚Äôt help with friends, sorry.  But for one day landmarks:  Freedom monument  Enjoy nice parks by the freedom monument  You can get a canal boat ride from this park, it‚Äôs surprisingly fun and goes out onto the main Daugava river briefly  Laima clock is where everyone used to meet for their dates, you can still see boys waiting with their bunch of flowers  Occupation museum is definitely worth a trip  House of Blackheads  Dome square and church - go inside and up stairs to top of spire  Latvian Museum of Natural History  Latvian War Museum, quite interesting and inside an old 13th century tower!   Walk half way across stone bridge (Akmens Tilts) for good view of river scene  Hotel Latvija - apparently this is a Radisson now - has bar on 36th floor with wraparound views",1,1692350432.0,2023-08-18 09:20:32

15jghyl,avatarname,"This is what puzzles me too, in Stockholm you can find Asian buffet type of places everywhere and on weekdays it costs maybe from as low as 13 euros... (our ''pusdienu piedavajums'' type) and Saturdays/Sundays price will go to 20-25 euros and upwards. I am not talking about places in fancy locations here. But in Riga when you look at brunch options, you will see 30 euros + and such, what gives? Prices are indeed extreme. I understand we have a lot of fucktards here who will treat ''all you can eat'' as ''all you can eat whole day and also stuff in the bag'' etc. but it is also not like Stockholm too is full of wonderfully mannered people today, there are a lot of immigrants from similar cultural background to our defective ''homo sovieticus'', but still they manage. If we had such places for say 16 euros I would go there from time to time, but we seem to have just brunch places for over 25 euros... And I think 16 euro price would scare away any of such fucktards that destroy the place. But sine such do not exist, maybe they have calculated that only 25 euros + scare away the crowd that would abuse all you can eat? And only at that price it makes sense here either because there are not that many people who want this and/or otherwise they would have a lot of people who not just eat shit-ton but also steal",1,1712907816.0,2024-04-12 07:43:36
15jghyl,Markd0ne,Haven't seen such restaurants. But some restaurants on weekends offer brunches with all you can eat buffet. Annas dƒÅrzs has very good brunches on weekends but you have to book it in advance.,1,1691395146.0,2023-08-07 07:59:06

15emkwn,ro4ers,"Osiris has a decent steak and is sort of a historically artistic place thats been open for 30 years.   Otherwise, go to Hereford - the owner has his own farm, where he grows the livestock for the meat, and they have pretty good chefs for the meat prep. On the other hand, the sides are lacking.  Do NOT go to Steiku Haoss. It's overpriced crap, and you can get a way better steak in most decent restaurants here.",2,1690847345.0,2023-07-31 23:49:05
15emkwn,pferden,"I really enjoyed the viewpoints and went on two. I slightly preferred the latvian academy of sciences as you can see the zeppelin (market) halls and the train bridge well. Also the random office walk to get to the viewing plattform was excellent. The other one was st. Peters of course, where you have a good view of the old town.  If you have time go to the market halls in the morning. It‚Äôs one of these more rough markets that tend to disappear over time in europe.  To eat latvian food go to either lido or milda (fir lunch; dinner needs res)  If fore some reason you need a romantic cafe try parunasim  Drink some ukrainian cherry liquor to give yourself a warm welcome to riga at piana vyshnia",2,1690849375.0,2023-08-01 00:22:55
