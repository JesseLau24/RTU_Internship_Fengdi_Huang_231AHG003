1idwwmv,Dewi_w,"Depending on your trip dates, you might be lucky. We have an event called ""Museum Night"" and it will be happening on May 17th. Not all museums will be participating, but the ones that will will be opened till late hours, have free entry and most likely have a special exhibition. Yes, there will be queues in more popular museums, but it will be atmospheric.   From the museums you mentioned, I would suggest looking up Latvian Railway History Museum in Riga and Riga Airmuseum. Latvian Railway History Museum is quite small, but there are old train and carriage models that you can go inside and explore. I haven\`t been there for a while, but hope they still allow it, because that was the reason it\`s my favorite museum in Riga. I haven\`t been in Riga Airmuseum, but I heard some good reviews about it, although it was closed for a while, but it seems to be open now",2,1738277756.0,2025-01-30 22:55:56

Even if it's not particularly romantic, if you have good memories, it will be special for both of you.    You could go somewhere with a nice view of the city, like the wheel, St Peter's church, Academy of Science, Skyline bar in Radisson maybe?    Pretty much anywhere in the old town is very beautiful too, the narrow cobblestone streets are fairly charming. Or maybe walk along the river and do it there.    You could also go outside of Riga, such as the seaside or walk about in nature if that's your wibe. Latvian woods are very peaceful. That would make a romantic setting for a proposal too, take a wee picnic basket with you.    Or do something more adventurous, hot air balloon ride maybe?",2,1737477662.0,2025-01-21 16:41:02

1i5s13v,xdox123,Someone already wrote that whole Latvia more or less seems depressive. This dark winter weather and people's tendency to wear dark clothes only adds to such impression.  People get tired at work and in general doesn't do small chitchat. I have seen enough posts where tourists wonder if latvians are rude to them because they don't do small talk and smile. But from other side why it's better in other countries? People there mostly do fake smiles although they probably hate their job. We just might be more realistic and try to preserve more mental strength. I actually prefer that others don't bother me with fake smiles and excessive talking. So it's fine with me that sellers mind their own business. Other than that most people tend to be friendly and kind if you know them closer. Just be polite in general even if there aren't that much smiling and talking.  Central market also tends to attract homeless people and people with addictions. Although there is security such people still are somewhere around there. Similar as in any other country.  Sellers in markets usually are old because that is hard work with low salary. Especially if they need to stand everyday outside in cold it does damage to health. Young people will try to seek easier and better paid work with more perspectives for future. Also not worth for young person to potentially damage health if selling happens in middle of street or not that well heated buildings. It's hard for older people to find job and they don't really expect future promotions so they can agree to such job. Many of those business owners aren't that rich either to find only good looking young workers.  If you can then try fair markets. Usually people are more cheerful there and also there is music. For example JƒÅ≈Üu midsummer market in Vecrƒ´ga. There might be some fair markets also for Easter. Usually sellers over there are owners of their small business and doesn't sell that often there for they can put more energy in selling.,4,1737399790.0,2025-01-20 19:03:10

I would probably either not shop or I would each time make them call their manager to say to leave me alone lol. In a way I see all such fakeness as disrespect.",1,1737567258.0,2025-01-22 17:34:18
