1c9tvy0,Intelligent-Quail262,"It was a bit more expensive in Riga than I expected! Some reddit threads say Poland and Germany(depending on for what) are cheaper. Shopping was not that cheap, but food and transport were :)  For spa ESPA was amazing, me and my friend had the two person say spa and loved it  For massage there are several Thai places with really good ratings. Reasonable prices for me at least. Paid 50 euro for 60 min  In general they are reeeeally bad at replying on WhatsApp and Instagram and often never get back to you, so that can be really frustrating. This goes for everything.   Google ""lash"" where you are staying and several places pop up, prices are from 20-50 euro (20 without color, and many places advise you to get the colour anyway or it's not optional).   For hairdressers it's also very difficult to get an appointment.  For teeth I went to sky Dream Clinic and had a very confusing experience (they didn't know the prices of their services, so it was kind of a surprise?), I got a teeth whitening home set for ~300 euro and they said the prices are around the same everywhere. But you need some time for this because it can take some days for them to make the imprint. And again they didn't answer on Instagram.",2,1715272636.0,2024-05-09 16:37:16

1c1br3r,Sweet_nSalty,"What ever you do do not apply for the EcOlive or Ventspils Loft apartments by LK group.  The landlord or building administrator is a piece of work. First red flags were these uncomfrotable sexist and racist comments like ""I don't rent for too dark people because they cook stinky foods"" and ""Because you are a woman, if you have any issues like changing a light bulb I will come there. If you were a man I would tell you to change it yourself.""   Later on there were a lot of un-announced visits... The building manager would just knock on the door evening around 21:00 and asked to just check the apartment. These happened frequently. He also gave uncomfrotable pet names for female residents and last drop was when he came to the apartment un-announced with his own keys. Once when I personally were home, and once when I had uni class, but had friend visiting. The friend was enraged that I did not tell them that my landlord was visiting and they were hanging in my flat with just their underwear... So yeah.  After those incidents I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible but had to fight for the deposit. All their contracts are for one year. Apparently it was totally fine for the landlord to break the contract by coming to the apartment whenever he wanted. On the rental agreement there was a paragraph that they can check the apartment but only if they announce it by text or email. They never texted about the visits, so for them to break the contract was fine, but not for me to cut the rental time shorter.",1,1718280630.0,2024-06-13 12:10:30

If you ask for bars/clubs where nice girls come to look for handsome guys - bad news. Thsoe are usually tourist trap places. You will get drunk, no sexy time and no wallet at the end.   Works same way as in any other country. Latvia is not Thailand.",3,1710427452.0,2024-03-14 14:44:12
