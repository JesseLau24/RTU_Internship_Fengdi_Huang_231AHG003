They also give spouses ability to work, which is not that common around the world.  You have to show proof of funds in your first year which can be more or less difficult, because the requirements for bank statements don't necessarily fit overseas banks statements. They didn't check on year 2, it was simply renewed with very little effort.

10a5y11,santajana2013,I would say March is still a winter month. At least for me.  I suggest to visit Open air museum if the weather is ok.,6,1673554461.0,2023-01-12 20:14:21
10a5y11,noturi,"Hello! First of all, Riga in march is very unpredictabe. There could be snow or there could be sunny, semi-warm spring weather, so prepare yourself for anything. Old town is beautiful by itself, but there are many tourist-trap places, so i would suggest taking a walk through it, in the evening go to the St.Peters Church and enjoy the view from the tower (open till 22:00). As i dont know what kind of a vibe you are looking for, im going to suggest different kinds. Che, Laska, Aleponija, Auss, Taka would be kind of alternative spots to have a drink and hang out. If you want some craft beer, then go to Labietis, Nurme, Trofeja, Miezis un kompƒÅnija. Sidrƒìrija, Biedrƒ´ba, M/Darbnƒ´ca are the spots for live music events. Visit ƒÄgenskalna tirgus second floor to have some lunch - there is nice food court. If you want a party on a weekend with DJs, drinks, good vibes, people in their 30s and food go to Space Falafel, Manana, HerbƒÅrijs, B Bar or Zefƒ´rs. General coctails, food and talking - one of This Place Doesnt Need a Name locations, BƒÅka, Snatch or RIONE (all of these places probably need a reservation beforehand). Really nice speakeasy bar is no saints (in front of italian embassy). If you want some fancy restaurant with amazing food and cocktails (these are going to be a bit pricey) JOHN, Barents, Whitehouse, COD, Tails. If you are looking for really good fast/street food, then enjoy Boar BBQ (this place is right nezt door to Nurme craft beer bar), OAK, Boo the burger, Kingu kebab. I know that suggesting museums some may consider lame, but i reeeeally suggest you to go and see Anatomy Museum - its newly renovated, really cool interactive stuff, basment floor is just mind blowing. If you dont have strong nerves, then consider maybe not going :D https://www.liveriga.com/en/11030-the-rsu-anatomy-museum/  But riga has cool Motormuseum as well: https://www.liveriga.com/en/1160-riga-motor-museum/",4,1673623229.0,2023-01-13 15:20:29

10a5y11,traktoriste,"-""Ala"" for traditional Latvian food (big portions, folk music in background but I suggest reservation.  - Another one that has a nice hobbit, medieval atmosphere would be ""LƒÅsƒ´te"". They sometimes have live medieval bands! Pumpkin soup is a must from that place. - For cheap Latvian food ""Lido"" and ""Lidojo≈°ƒÅ varde"" -For fish restaurant: ""Zivju lete"" - Bakery and coffee - ""K≈´kotava"" on Terbates street 10/12. Fancy classical cakes. Place for fancy grandmas who drink champagne with coffee and romantic dates. -For wine ""Vƒ´na studija"". They have nice food plates that you can pair with suggested wines. Usually busy on weekends. Reservation is suggested. - For beer, try ""Miezis"" or ""Labietis"" Latvian craft brewery. - For partying: most Latvians go to two bar and club districts nowadays. Those are full of different bars, breweries, concerts, and usually many people on weekends. Nice and easy way how to spend a night out. Usually no enterance fees. One is called ""Tallinas pagalms"" another one's location is ""ValdemƒÅras PasƒÅ≈æa""",4,1673604850.0,2023-01-13 10:14:10

10a5y11,traktoriste,"Thank you! Glad if it helps.   Another place that came to my mind is ""Two More Beers"" in the Old Town. It's touristic but the service, food, snacks and beer choice is so good that I'm willing to pay a bit extra.  For nice overview on the city, I suggest taking a ""Radisson"" hotel elevator to the top floor. Don't be amused to do it as it's generally something everyone does.  And for things outside Riga but still very easily accessible I would go in to total ""yolo"" mode and try bobsleigh on the real track. The track is open till 13th of March, so maybe you can manage! This city is less than hour away (and is nice itself for a half day trip) and has one of the best bobsleigh and luge tracks in the region. This experience is very unique: https://tourism.sigulda.lv/en/objects/what-to-do/active-holiday/adrenaline-and-sport/bobsleigh-and-luge-track-sigulda/",1,1673609494.0,2023-01-13 11:31:34
10a5y11,davebeastly,"**Trains and Buses** in Latvia are cheap so don't limit yourself to Old Town you can go out of Riga or to places in the suburbs for little money. You can buy bus e-tickets at a shop called Narvesen it's cheaper than buying from the bus driver. Trains are priced by zone but it's cheap forexample to go to the beach which is 30 mins from Riga (Riga - Majori) is ‚Ç¨1.43. The cheapest taxi company is probably Panda +37127228880 or you can also use the Bolt app to request a ride.    If you do choose to go out of the city like to the beach or to some other interesting spots let me know and I'll give you some options. Here's some stuff in Riga though:   **Riga Motor Museum** is in the suburbs so you'll need bus number 15 to Jugla.   **St Peter's Church** go up the spire of this church in Old Town for a panoramic view of the city and river.   **Latvian War Museum** is spread over 5 floors in old town and is free, bare in mind most museums close on Mondays so they can open Sunday.   **Ala Pagrabs** is a decent bar that does good food. Try a jug of Brenguƒºu alus (ale) and ƒ∑iploku grauzdi≈Üi (Latvia garlic bread).   **LIDO Atp≈´tas centrs** is a huge canteen style restaurant and bar that does every Latvian dish imaginable which due to it being a canteen style you can see exactly what you're getting. Their potato fries are particularly moreish also they brew their own beer which is decent and comes in a steins.   **Skyline bar** is a generic fancy hotel bar, but the view from the 23rd floor is one of the best in Riga also free peanuts.   **Events**, You can check this site for events happening around March: [https://www.liveriga.com/en/](https://www.liveriga.com/en/)     **Lastly some random advice:** Most people in their 40s or younger can speak English, so don't be afraid to speak or ask a stranger for help. They will probably be more helpful if you attempt to address them in Lativan though, so here's some basics:  Sveiki (svay-ki) means hello. L≈´dzu (Lood-zu) means ""please"" and ""you're welcome"". Paldies (Pal-di-es) means ""thanks"". atƒÅ (a-tah) means ""bye"". You can just say sorry in English though as the Latvian word for that is pretty difficult to pronounce. In terms of ordering food from a menu or reading signs the language is pronounced as it is spelled: ""a"" is just ""a, not ""ae"" i.e. there's no multiple sounds for one letter like in English. ""c"" is a ""ts"" sound and ""j"" is ""y"".  Don't be offended if you don't always get a ""please"" and ""thank you"" or ""how are you?"", ""how's your food?"" from the cashiers or wait staff like in the UK, those Americanisms are not so common here yet.  Oh and there will probably be a guy in Old Riga at somepoint trying to get you to go to Victory Pub he might tell you it's a British Pub, but it's actaully a low-key strip club.",2,1674219681.0,2023-01-20 13:01:21
