1goeq8s,Spiritual-Jello-9970,"Too early to say, since most places will announce their plans closer to the NY. I would say that all the places can be divided in 4 categories:  1) All-inclusive parties. Those will start from 200 EUR, have dinner, some kind of entertainment, alcohol included (or, at least, bring your own drinks policy). Here's a list - https://www.lattravel.lv/1627.html. The downside is that they are expensive, you might not find any friends there since people will come in their own companies, and they might not be in English. If you are staying in a big hotel, chances are they will have something like this, so try contacting them. The positive is that you pay at once and are busy until the morning.  2) Most restaurants will probably work by reservations in order to avoid wasting resources on passers-by who just want to warm up with a tea or something. Those are usually high - end places, might ask for a deposit during reservation and might have some kind of compliment or celebration, but not as complex as the option Nr. 1. They will probably close soon after 12 and they are a good option if you just want a festive dinner without anyone bothering you, but nothing like a party.  3) Bars and nightclubs will probably be open for anyone until the morning, but thats a hit or miss. You might find a cool place, make local and foreign friends and dance to cool music. At the same time you might end up in 30 minute line for a coctail, step in someones puke or get in fight. Then again, they will either be free of charge or cost a symbolic price to enter, so you can always just move along to the next place.   4) Some places can be closed, so if you have something in mind, you should check whether or not this place will be open in advance.  If you have preferences and know your budget, I can give you some suggestions.",8,1731320938.0,2024-11-11 10:28:58

1gln409,Amimimiii,"Yeah, unfortunately I think a lot is dependent not as much on the police (as they are basically doing voluntary work, the pay is shit and the job is very tiring) but on society as a whole. Our society is generally very passive tho, especially the bad things in our own society we are sort of ashamed of and often don’t want to talk about. It’s easy protesting against wars elsewhere, it’s much more difficult to protest to fix our own interior defense structures. There are of course plenty of help lines for youth to call if they have a problem but those addicted to substances often don’t consider it a problem but rather as an escape from other issues :(",2,1731180860.0,2024-11-09 19:34:20

1gln409,IIWhiteHawkII,"Totally the opposite. I used to study at RTRIT on Marijas Street. Every day, I'd head to Origo during my break and then pass through it to get to another university in the evening. Sure, there were always a few sketchy people around, but they mostly kept to themselves, and any real trouble was super rare and usually over quickly. I never saw as much trash back then as I see in the weekly reports on social media now.  I think it’s because areas where these folks used to hang out have become more “civilized” over time—places like Centraltirgus, the areas around the Central Station, and even parts of Maskavas. As these places improved, it pushed the bums and junkies over to Origo.  The next step is to actually increase police patrols here. I don’t know where these people will go, and honestly, I don’t care. But yeah, it’s time for action because it’s definitely worse than it was 5–8 years ago.",2,1730982147.0,2024-11-07 12:22:27
1gln409,ThrowMeAwayFuuuck,"Fully agree. The turning point wasn't those areas becoming civilized. These people used to hang out behind the central station, around the bus stop of the central market. Also around the areas where you would exit the tunnels from the central station near the Satiksmes ministrija building. They moved to the front when a large chunk of that area became a construction site due to the rail baltica project. I know someone who works there and goes to work there daily and they pointed it out immediately when the construction started. How those people's favorite hangout spots are unreachable now, so they moved to more visible areas.    And when the first chunk of the sketchy residents started hanging out in the front, that's when more children appeared as well.    ""Back in my youth"" the area in front of Origo was the hangout place for the first wave of the emo kids simply because people often went there to hangout when they would take a train to the capital. Like if you're one of those kids, you probably don't have many friends in your hometown, so you would take a train to the capital to hang out with other rebellious types. I am not that ingrained into the current youth culture now, since I am not their age. But I do know that there has definitely been the emo resurgence, with that subculture becoming popular again. And if the rebellious types choose the area to be their hangout spot again and now there are more of the sketchy types, it can become an environment of a bad influence for these vulnerable kids.",4,1731044865.0,2024-11-08 05:47:45
1gln409,[deleted],"Yup, anyone remember central market a few years ago?

Nobody even paid attention, security just walked past. Try to do it now, i have seen security taking out some suspicious people or bums these days. The central station and surroundings are SAFEST than they have been, ever. The kids were there for ever, they just came out now as they don't have much places to hang out anymore. Basically all the troublesome kids are from all the Riga is around origo atm...it wasn't the case 10 or more years ago.  I have argued with my parents on the topic..they say the same - Riga has gotten worst, but then i hear stories of my father jumping in random wedding during the 80's and starting a massive brawl in the center of Riga (as he told, on street of lenin, Brīvības now). I haven't seen any serious brawl in bars for at least 5 years...when in my 20-ies going out on weekend was also ""be ready to fight"", especially young, drunk  ""martial artists"" who just came from their first kickboxing training.

1gln409,TheoKeys,"My father’s entire family was Latvian. They came to the US in the late 1800s through the 1920s and as far as I know, I was the first one to come back. The irony is that I took 4 years of Russian in high school anticipating a visit- and we see how that turned out.  First visited in 2023 for 4 days, liked it so much we rented an apartment in old town for a month (June) this year. Already have a place next June, more in the Centrs area.  I love the architecture- the contrast between the Art Nouveau and the Soviet era. The cultural stuff- we went to the Opera House for a performance of the Verdi Requiem and it was fantastic. Love M/Darbnica- was really impressed with the jazz scene there. The museums (particularly the arr museum) are amazing. The food scene was much more varied than I expected.  The people reminded me of my father’s family.  Not very gregarious until you got to know them, but very bright with a dry, smart-ass sense of humor.i had great interactions with everyone we met.  As far as traveling to the US, I would certainly never discourage anyone from coming over. If you’re thinking rural, I would strongly recommend West Texas and the Big Bend area. It’s almost surreal, totally unlike any place like it anywhere in the world and very desolate. Colorado is fantastic as well. As far as riding a horse – it’s definitely overrated, but worth doing at least once..  As far as cities go,  I’d definitely recommend New York. Ignore all the scary stories, it’s way, way safer than it was back in the 70s. You could spend a month there and not get bored. You might also look at Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington DC. And New Orleans – my favorite city in the United States (to visit).  Anyway, didn’t mean to ramble, but I think my interest in Latvia is largely due to my family connection.

1gdxsi0,psihius,"The overall cleanliness is due to the laws we have.  Owners of buildings are responsible for daily upkeep of their territory by law. In city centre they are required to have an urn for trash and timely emptying it so it does not overflow. They either have to employ someone who's job it is to keep things clean or employ a company that provides the service. The fines are pretty steep and you will find out almost immediately that it is far cheaper to keep things clean.  This rule about trash cans being available everywhere and being a certain density is what makes disposing of trash trivial. Every store has at least one, usually a few. Every public transport stop has one. Every building in the city centre has one. Out in the less densely built areas, there are rules around there being some kind of way to dispose of trash.  Abandoned stuff might take a while to deal (going through all the legal stuff), but in the end if you ignore it, the municipality will do the cleanup and send you a bill. Eventually, if owners ignore those things, courts get involved and things get sold off.  Latvia historically had a thing for keeping our streets clean and we have laws that reinforce them, so any kind of property ownership includes either you directly being responsible for organising the upkeep (yourself, having a contract with a service or employing people directly) or your management company doing that in the case of apartments.",6,1730116236.0,2024-10-28 11:50:36

Checkout their Instagram and or Facebook they might be posting some events. Oh and in Greenwood you can probably also buy grips if you're that type of competitive player.  I used to be a competitive foosball player and these are the places where we used to play casually. Sadly there are no proper clubs for playing foos anymore. That's a long time ago but I know Armory, Distillers, Banshee and Greenwood still have decent tables and the owners are looking after them to make sure they're in playable condition.",3,1730048609.0,2024-10-27 17:03:29

1gdewof,TurboHoboo,Möku Riga (Skolas 35) has free foosball but it's in a terrible condution. Then there's Zebras (Dzirnavu 104). Would recomend that!  Also Aussie Pub (Vaļņu 43) in the Old Town.,2,1730056789.0,2024-10-27 19:19:49
