Because an international kindergarten or school is like at least 1500€ per month. And as a non local you wouldn’t bring most likely any furniture or other things (child toys, bicycles, skis, car), so there is quite large investments on that side. So I would say the result would be good decent upper middle class life, with like 1 major tourism trip per year.  Quiet center (klusais centrs) is great with a child, there are like 3 great parks with children play zones, everything is in walking distance, no need for a car.

Not a single argument, not a single reason, not a single proposal for resolution of the issue. My apologies to you if I called you pro-Russian and you are not pro-Russian, but this is a behaviour of a Russian troll farm account – answer to anything positive about the country with a negative remark, usually without any argumentation. Do you think you contributed to the discussion or gave any useful context to the foreigner asking the question, which is what this whole thread is about?     The French thing reminded me of something Roosevelt once said. I'll paste it down below as I think this quote could be useful to you. He said it in Paris.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""   ""Complaining about a problem without proposing a solution is called whining"".",1,1738963792.0,2025-02-07 21:29:52

1ii2u1x,abadsquirrel,"Most of those have metro, so you can't really compare. Even so, I'd argue Budapest and _maybe_ Prague have almost perfect connections - even excluding metro - and accessibility. I've been to Budapest like four times and the ease of use is such a joy always. Although that is my personal opinion. I detested public transport in many Polish cities as a tourist due to lack of English and ease of use. Although it's definitely getting better there as they are implementing combined e-tickets throughout the country. Italy and Greece on the other hand was not a lot of fun time to take a bus. You could may as well not look on the timetables at all. Although I haven't been to many cities there, so it may depend on the region.  You compiled a list, yet didn't say what is it you consider good or bad? You're just making angry noise. That's why you're getting downwoted.  For the sake of discussion, I feel Riga is way better than Vilnius in terms of public transport and car infrastructure. Tallinn I haven't used really so can't say though. I'm sure it's also good. Riga is relatively accessible without a car  nowadays, and you _can_ travel mostly from everywhere to everywhere. Prices are not cheap but they are not really expensive comparatively also. The 90minute ticket is really good price per value in my opinion. I've heard they're planning to combine train into a standard ticket as well which is great. You mostly can rely on the timetables. Biggest downside to me personally is it just takes so much time to commute to remote places or over entire city from one side of Daugava to the other. What is it that you so don't like?",2,1738754941.0,2025-02-05 11:29:01
1ii2u1x,janiskr,"Can it be better, sure, can it be more often, sure. Is it bad, no it is not. It comes regularly, it is mostly on time. With more bus lanes it is more on time than it was before.  So, the actual negatives - it only goes to wherever you are to the city centre and then from the city centre it goes elsewhere or back where you came from. So, moving from neighbouring locales in Riga will not be optimal.",1,1738754086.0,2025-02-05 11:14:46
1ii2u1x,Accomplished-Talk578,Thanks for asking. I was living in Riga for 3 years without a car and it was good. I only bought a car when felt need to travel 50km out of town frequently. The network of trams and busses is organised in a way that you always can find connections. Schedules are available online to plan journeys. Vehicle fleet is pretty decent. It’s cheap. Taxis are cheap as dirt. Car sharing is always there including cargo vehicles suitable for category B drivers. Is there anything I’m missing?,1,1738770586.0,2025-02-05 15:49:46
1ii2u1x,Markuski32,It’s really good and costs 1.50€ for 90 minutes or 5€ for a day. It’s easiest to buy the tickets from mobile app Mobilly. It has also an extensive tram network. If you have places far away check on Google Maps and decide for yourself.,4,1738740324.0,2025-02-05 07:25:24

1ii6hbk,specialistsA,"Worked as a Bolt and Wolt courier for around 2-3 years. Local Latvian.  All foreigners are applying to a courier job as its the easiest and most popular option. Nothing to do with racism or standing above. Here unfortunately we dont have massive warehousing's, production sites or any other simple labor work. We have but in limited options and usually they are filled up already + the international and regional crisis/stagnation etc. A lot of force major situations here and I cant give you one answer. But in general the local market is slowly opening up for foreigners. The barrier is the language and employer preferences.  ok, now about courier jobs - in Wolt they are paid decent, you get above minimum 2.50EUR+ for orders and a lot of regular customer ordering from the app usually. I had few customers ordering regularly. Wolt is also better in caring about their employee (show your attitude and Wolt will appreciate it and give decent support with order issues etc.) Bikes receiver the least amount of orders, because ordering algorithm prioritizes cars (big orders, super markets etc). + the competition for order picking. The golden ages were Covid times - I used to start to work after 5PM and until 10PM or Midnight (depending on the restrictions) I would get a minimum of 50 EUR for min 4 hours work. Now you wont see this kind of tips and delivery earnings. Above it, job its self is really challenging - weather conditions, long hours, roads, traffic, accidents and usually - lack of orders.  And speaking of Bolt - complete opposite attitude, lack of orders, weird cash ordering system and lets say not the best environment comparing to Wolt.  And last but not least - the taxes + social security payments. If your order from Bolt is typically 1.80 EUR, then after all taxes, you will receive just 1.26 EUR. If you do the math, thats not a lot for this hustle. If you do it officially which I did. It also depends on your employee status (self-employed, small company etc)  So this would be my perspective and you could see a lot of Latvians delivering with cars, rather than like me on a bike. Its also usually is just a side hustle.",3,1738750783.0,2025-02-05 10:19:43

1ifxmra,Spiritual-Jello-9970,"I'm not familiar with the exact house, but I will make an educated guess (based on my experience in the field and having recently searched for and purchased an apartment in similar house and neighbourhood), as well as give you a few tips.    The house is not included in the ""grausts saraksts"" (ruin list), which is a list of houses in Riga that are in unsatisfactorily condition, which is, obviously good. It also has, as far as I see on google maps, a renovated facade. It is  common practice to restore the facade last, which means that, probably, there is nothing wrong on the inside (communications, attic, basement e.t.c.). Ask for the previous utility bill. Check whether there are any positions like ""restoration fund"", and if there is, ask what is it for.   The utility bill is being issued by the service company. Check the reviews for the company online. While on site, check the sound isolation (whether you can hear the neighbours), check the water pressure and how fast the water heats. Also, just have a walk by the building at evening time and check how occupied is the building. For pre-war houses, obviously, the more people - the better, since you don't want a half abandoned old house.   The neighbourhood is nice. Old town is about 15 minutes away, the street is quite in this part and green.   Don't expect it to be ""the centre"" though. No bankers and diplomats in this area. But it is a very perspective neighbourhood thanks to its historical heritage and proximity to centre. I would say it will get better and the prices will rise. I would consider purchasing apartment there, but of course, all depends on the details and whether or not the price is adequate.",4,1738506480.0,2025-02-02 14:28:00
1ifxmra,Cyxoi,Appreciate the detailed response and great tips! I know the area and have heard about some projects that will definitely make it more appealing and push prices up,2,1738514388.0,2025-02-02 16:39:48
1ifxmra,_teatea,"I would not be so optimistic that its fine ""inside"", just because it looks good from street.  Seems like only facade was renovated - [https://buvinzenierusavieniba.lv/renoveta-vesturiska-nama-fasade-gertrudes-iela](https://buvinzenierusavieniba.lv/renoveta-vesturiska-nama-fasade-gertrudes-iela) . And it was done just because of potential increase of tax.   So yes, better check of water/waste tubes are replaced, electricity, etc. critical infrastructure. And expect that older houses soon will require more investments...  What else could be weakest part in 1910 year built house - pre-war houses have wooden planks between floors (no idea how it is English ""starpstāvu pārsegumi"" :) ), so if its regularly wet, could be very expensive to replace.   If possible ask to visit the basement how well kept it is - its also risky area",2,1738606534.0,2025-02-03 18:15:34
1ifxmra,Spiritual-Jello-9970,"It just probably means that there were no other renovations required. Because a lot of inner works - attic, basement, and even communications - can potentially damage the facade, require removal of some parts or just be plain out messy.    It's just illogical to start with the facade. Not saying it can't be done- no law against it. Its just like when renovating you own apartment you for some reason decide to start with cosmetics - paint the walls, put up ceiling and new lights, knowing full well that the electrical wiring is bad and you will need to deal with it in a few years.   As I said - it's just a guess based on logic and knowing how the business works. ",1,1738610168.0,2025-02-03 19:16:08
1ifxmra,rolandsozolins,"All good points previously mentioned. I would stress the following: check if tenants collect adequate maintanance and repair funding to be able to finance unexpected repairs. Or else you may end up with appartment on top floor and noone  willing to pay for lift repairs.  Knowing the collapsing demographics I would only invest if I new house doesnt require any major repair in next 20 years, such as changing the heating, water or waste systems.",2,1738586980.0,2025-02-03 12:49:40

( why, because sometimes if you are unlucky item does not arrive on time an gets delayed several times, so you can just move on  other store and dont need to wait for your money ). hope it helps :)",1,1738910737.0,2025-02-07 06:45:37
