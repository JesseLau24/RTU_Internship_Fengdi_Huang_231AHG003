1938yhx,narrative_device,"Sadly, racism is pretty abundant throughout Europe, even in the UK where a man of Indian descent can become Prime Minister, it's definitely a thing. And in countries without a history of intensive multiculturalism it's a lot more visible and lot more present. You'll see for yourself  that there is alot more casual everyday racism in the countries which used to be under Russian occupation in the times of the Soviet Union.   In Latvia's defence, the people have lived through centuries of struggle, fighting and suffering to keep their culture and language alive - a history like that is always going to lead to a certain cultural protectiveness and even defensiveness. Some people are going to be hostile, that's the reality you'll have to expect. Some people are going make assumptions because you're Indian, like thinking that you're probably sexist or other similar negative stereotypes. This hasn't been helped by the fact that most Latvians experience of Indian people has been via international students who can sometimes be more entitled and less respectful than  other migrants and visitors.  But while Latvians are slow to warm up to strangers, they be can be very generous and welcoming if you make the effort to learn the language and respect the culture. Especially the language part. **The key to belonging in Latvia is learning the fucking language.**  The truth is that most people going to be indifferent to you, or even cold. That's not a racism thing, that's just a Latvian thing. If you're an intravert you're going to love that.   Good luck.",2,1705045938.0,2024-01-12 07:52:18

18xx5uz,tatouzze,Thanks for this very comprenhensive answer ! Appriciate it :). So i've found a 3 bedroom appartement for student on this website: https://rigastudentapartment.com/. I Hope it's not a scam or something but it seems pretty safe since i've reach out to a former student who used to live their. Also the rent is 440/person/month and I was wonderring if it's a normal price ? It's almost as expensive as in France which suprises me..,1,1705407867.0,2024-01-16 12:24:27
18xx5uz,Unlikely_Author_607,"Welcome!! They are not a scam but for the spring semester rent only of 440 per person sounds pretty high, try PINECONE (Pinecone-properties.com) or agents from the group I mentioned before, as the semester is approaching you can find something even for 300 per person plus utilities",1,1705883308.0,2024-01-22 00:28:28
18xx5uz,Unlikely_Author_607,"The prices are higher then the market as you will rent for a shorter period. While renting per year as minimum, the rent prices are much lower",1,1705883389.0,2024-01-22 00:29:49
