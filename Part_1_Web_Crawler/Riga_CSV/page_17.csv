1f9smy9,beccasowner2021,We were just there last month and felt that Cesis definitely had a lot more to offer than Rundale Palace.  I think the admission fee for Rundale was a lot higher as well.    We spent hours exploring Cesis - checking out the tower with the only source of light being a handheld candlelit lantern was such a unique experience. They also had artisans showing various crafts.

1f9smy9,Onetwodash,"With time this short, Cesis (or Sigulda!) would take priority over Rundale.  Rundale is best around when roses are in full bloom. It's notable for being a French-style palace this far in the north, that's well renovated and has beautiful garden built and maintained around it.  If you've seen Versailles, you already have a photobook of French style palaces though so... yeah. Would still be worth it in May and it's really cool for when they have some events (like concerts, theaters, galas), but you're visiting in September.  Cesis/Sigulda are prettiest when leaves start changing colors in autumn - what may or may not be around the time for your trip, but there's at least a chance. They're both in very scenic locations overlooking Gauja valley, both have centuries old castle ruins (Sigulda has two and has plenty of scenic spots cleared of the tree coverage for picture taking across the valley), interesting history to go with it and such. Cesis is very quaint old town itself, Sigulda however is not.  Do note that while Latvia in general is super flat, Cesis and especially Sigulda are the exceptions, there's a lot of elevation change, stairs and such - something to keep in mind if you have mobility issues.  If you're into photography, Sigulda would be the standard suggestion - assuming the weather is good and trees are starting to color golden/red.  If weather is rubbish  or you specifically want the old quaint town vibes - Cesis.  Sigulda/Cesis are also served by a comfy train line.  Train stops in the respective town centers for both, very walkable distance from everywhere you wanted to get. Sigulda has in-city buses if you don't want to walk all the way to Turaida castle and back, although a cooler option is to use the cable car across the river.",1,1725602571.0,2024-09-06 06:02:51
1f9smy9,Syntonomy617,"Thanks for the detailed answer.  That was what I was thinking about regarding Rundale, might have been better in late spring/early summer, but this is going to basically be last week of September.  Sigulda was my other option as well, and although I do not have mobility issues, I see that Sigulda has a lot of hiking, which I don't like doing too much.  I don't mind elevation changes and stairs in city walking, not sure why.",1,1725644810.0,2024-09-06 17:46:50

1f9smy9,Onetwodash,"Depends how much trekking you plan to do and would have to check public transport schedule if trying to use that. I wouldn't really recommend trying to fit both in same day unless you have a car AND plan to just check out main sights in both. Trekking takes time and energy.    It's different time of year now though, Rundāle gardens might be blooming soon - depends on what sort of history/architecture you want to see, where you're from etc.",1,1744743538.0,2025-04-15 18:58:58
1f9smy9,[deleted],Thanks - I love medieval style castles so the castles are highly preferred vs. palace. I’ve seen Versailles’ garden and a few other European palaces and so far none beat the Versailles one. I know the traveling time between both takes about an hour by public transport. But I plan to go super early in Cesis and probably start wandering around till 10am when the castle opens then tour that before heading to Sigulda for some more trekking in the trails.,1,1744749417.0,2025-04-15 20:36:57

But it’s also quite a hike from Riga and as other commenters have said, it’s kinda just Rundale. Bauska is ok, but it’s no cesis. Cesis is a cute small ish quiet town with restaurants, bars, walks, and access to Gauja river, if that’s something you’re interested in. I’ve never done the castle tour so I can’t speak to that but I may vote cesis. It’s just a matter of if you want castle and city life, or just castle, imo",1,1725617265.0,2024-09-06 10:07:45

If you are willing to go outside of ogre for traning there is ""Salaspils GTK"" that is located in salaspils the trainers there are very good, the people are very friendly too, and training costs around 5 eur per traning sesion so it is reasonable.  If training doesnt interest you that much there are 2  sites lgtf.lv and tt.esit.lv these are the main tt sites in latvia. there you can see and sign up for tournaments that will happen soon although im warning you that most if not all tournaments have a entrence fee and if its your first time playing in a competetive tournament you will also have to pay for a liscemce (10 eur i think).

Drunk British guys over for stag parties. So everyone looking like a British tourist was viewed with suspicion. They're typically white though so that 'totally wasn't racism', whites can't be racist towards other whites, right?   Current suspicion towards young middle-eastern males is similar.

Here’s what I can tell you: most of the older generation here doesn’t speak English, so they might seem a bit annoyed, not because of how you look, but because they’re probably afraid you’ll ask them something they can’t understand. 😂  People in Latvia aren’t racist. We have a lot of students from all over the world studying at Stradiņš University, so we’re pretty used to different nationalities and races, especially in Riga. I’m almost certain that what you experienced wasn’t about you personally—it was likely just that the person felt uncomfortable and didn’t know how to handle the situation, so they wanted to avoid it.🥴  Latvians aren’t the best at showing emotions, so don’t worry too much. We’re not bad people, but you might not get a lot of smiles or overly polite behavior. It’s just how it is here.🤷🏼‍♀️  P.S. Don’t even try to compare US to Latvia when it comes to customer service—it’s just not on the same level. Here, if someone’s having a bad day, trust me, you’re going to know it by the way they treat you.😂 The whole “customer is always right” thing doesn’t really exist in Latvia. Just don’t take it personally. We’re used to it. Honestly, I find it so wild (in a good way) in US how random people smile at you, say hi, and always seem to be in a good mood.

1f0stko,xdox123,"One of reasons for dislike and mistrust towards outsiders (more specifically eastern and African men) can be due to illegal immigrants what Merkel some time ago let in EU. Obviously not every immigrant or traveler would be bad person, but please understand why local people can have their opinions. Vast majority of those illegal immigrants didn't came here to do honest work, instead they built their ghettos, they made peaceful cities dangerous, they are aggressive towards woman and other local beliefs and religions. It didn't affect Latvia as severely since we don't have such rich benefits here, but we do see what is happening in other European countries. So yes, we will stand up for our own values, land and also woman. To call that ""racism"" would be incorrect. You think that other cultures don't protect their woman and values? People in US also have their own to protect, we over several seas have ours. Fair enough? Everyone have their boarders and limits as to how far they can be welcoming. Here we also have ongoing war in neighboring country. They call us ""russophobes"", ""fascists"" and even ""dogs"" for not wanting to give up our own language, history and even country. Like - where does this stop and doesn't become some ""...phobe"" or ""racist"" thing? EU cities are trashed, woman r\*ped, in other countries bombs are falling. Meanwhile someone in shop starred at someone bit too long and didn't say anything much? I'm sure there are all sorts of problems in US.  Obviously there are more or less actually racist people as everywhere, but lots of it is just each persons perception and cultural thing. For example in US there are lots of fake smiles and talking, but I see that as rude and even sort of aggressive. While if someone from US comes here they might think that Latvians are rude (or even racist?) because they don't have fake smiles each time someone walks in their shop, cashiers don't ask ""how are you"" and don't chit chat about life. Also there can be difference between Latvians and those Russians who live here. Russians tend to be more bold and racistic, especially older generations. There are also those who hate Latvia and Latvians, yet they stay here for decades. Sometimes when I talk to them in Latvian they also just stare and are slow to answer.

Try Russian , they will probably respond very quickly. There are lot of Indians in LV , and I work with lot of them , sure they raise eyebrows , as they are untypical to most, so yea, there will always be a stare , more or less obvious, which is not always negative, its just ""oh its foreigner i dont see every day"", but I have yet to see any of them complaining there is real issue of getting service at the stores.    In general - racist tendencies, probably we are slightly more ""xenophobic"" than west ,as most former eastern block tend to be , but but there certainly isnt any notable race based discrimination. One could argue that Russians are discriminated in light of Ukraine war , but general racism, no. People here tend to not be going out of their way to be extra tollerant like in Scandinavia , but its very rare to have actual racism case one could argue over.",1,1724781267.0,2024-08-27 17:54:27
1f0stko,Brief-List5772,"If you are black, you are an exotic here in Northern Europe.  People will always be suspicious of anything foreign, it's human nature, it's encoded in our genes.  I think mostly people are interested in your intentions here and whether you are ready to respect our culture.  I am not racist, but I do not support the idea of European multiculturalism in any way, because we see very well what it brings.  Don't be offended, these are simply facts.   I don't know you personally, maybe you are a nice person, but coming to a foreign country, looking different, you can't expect to be accepted as one of your own.  When white people go to Africa, they get exactly the same looks. And one more fact - we latvians are not friendly by nature.

I live in countryside, far from Riga, and people here might have their own rats in attic, but you get normal attitude in store. In Riga, everyone looks at you like how dare you ask them or interrupt their precious time, even when they literally are just doing their work. Reason? Try to work minimal wage job with living costs in Riga - there you go. Is there some level of racism toward middle eastern people? Well, I can't say very much about that, because I've no idea how you look like to judge of your looks, but I also can't say middle eastern people are doing good job at making their culture look like friendly and nice. Plus, as some already pointed out - sorry, we don't really have much race diversity here, so if you stand out of crowd, get used to people staring. And don't be Karen that takes everything as 'racism'. Staring is not racism. If white person would travel to some africa jungle, they also would be stared at bc they look different. This isn't America for you (thankfully, tho), where you can meet Asian, black, middle eastern people on every corner, therefore you mingle in crowd. Not a thing here.
