1kps9zs,Dewi_w,"If there were no credit cards, contacting the police is all you need to do to prevent major troubles, I believe.  Usually all found items end up at the police, but they may take the long route. First, calmly look trough your items at home. It happens. In panic mind may not be so clear. Make sure you now when was the last time you were sure that the wallet was with you. If you lost it in the middle of the street and somebody found it, the may turn it to the police tomorrow, because today is Sunday. If you lost it close to the bus stop and someone found it, they might have turned it to the community transport lost and found department. If by bus station you mean the Riga bus station, they have an info center, where you can ask about found items. Also usually people post about lost and found items in special facebook groups, check groups dedicated to the Kengarags and nearest areas and also general ""pazaudēts"" un ""atrasts"" groups. Also, if I found a wallet with foreign id in it, as an option I would bring it the consulate of that country if it would be closer than the police station. If there was also a local student id, people might turn it to your university.
