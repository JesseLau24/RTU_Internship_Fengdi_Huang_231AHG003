11wc2l1,weedexperts,"Old town , central market, day trip to Jurmala, walk around Me≈æaparks. Check out some of the old churches. Maybe you can take a day trip to Sigulda or go walking in Kemeri national park.",6,1679320701.0,2023-03-20 13:58:21
11wc2l1,yung_lank,"Take a day trip to Cesis. It‚Äôs a neat little town bout an hour and a half each way. Jurmala could also be a nice day trip although it‚Äôs better in summer. Old Riga is good touristy stuff, but overpriced. Centrs is super cool architecture + nice parks and a few museums (occupation and more), Centralitirgus (central markets) is neat to look at as a tourist and a 10 ish minute walk from old Riga. Also holocaust museum near there. Agenskalns is kinda cute, but not super touristy. Agenskalntirgus (I forgot actual name but it‚Äôs market there) has cool hipster vibes if that‚Äôs ur thing. As someone else said Me≈æaparks is nice. Zoo + pretty lake + good walking trails.",5,1679364571.0,2023-03-21 02:09:31

11wc2l1,Homeyarc,"The free walking tour is a great way to get a good idea of where to go - the old market by the train station is good for cheap street food and good beer.   A Sigulda day trip on the train, go on the cable car and lots of forest walking is something else to consider other than just Riga.",2,1679337643.0,2023-03-20 18:40:43

11wc2l1,[deleted],"My ideas are :  Try LielvƒÅrdes Tum≈°ais beer or Piebalgas beer - Visit the freedom monument while the soldiers are there with their Cadre around noon. - Go to a pizza restaurant and be given a fork and knife (joke) - Visit the three churches of old riga, and see the old city from across the Daugava river on the coast area near the Swedebank Tower. The churches stick out for a distinct picture.   Oh, and spend a good long while in the War Museum, to understand the soviet invasion. (Slava ukraini)",1,1680638696.0,2023-04-04 20:04:56
