For two people it costs 50 euros to buy a week's worth of food  Riga has a very sea climate, few sunny days, and I take vitamin **D** regularly.  I myself ran away from the threat from russia and I am afraid that something might happen here, but this is the only place where I can live normally so far.  Jobs are pretty scarce. Salaries are low. I'm self-employed, so I don't have a problem with that. It is worth considering that half of the population of Riga speaks Russian, and the older generation does not know English.  Latvian is a very old and difficult language.  I did two years at uni and left. The quality of education is high. I was in an English-speaking group with all sorts of asian people.  I don't like the service industry. There are always different Indians or Arabs there who don't even know English properly, ""hand"" language helps.

Here is some info:  Duty free is a scam in all countries, because excise taxes still must be paid regardless, when travelling within Schengen/EU/a country. VAT may apply too in some cases.  There is such a thing as airport tax in most of the world's airports. It is not a tax per-se, but instead, shops must pay commissions to airports they operate in. These airport ""taxes"" are insanely huge in Germany, Spain and Scandi countries.  That's how airports remain profitable.   But really, duty-free is just a name, nothing else.

1gwo0mk,AWonderlustKing,I doubt anything will be open on the 24th other than bars that cater exclusively to tourists (if even that) since Latvians celebrate Christmas on the evening of the 24th rather than the 25th.  On the 25th the Old Town should be a bit more open than on the 24th. I would recommend personally 3 PavƒÅri - a Michelin guide restaurant in the old town owned and run by Latvia's most well-known celebrity chef.

Both restaurants are high-end in terms of food quality but still maintain a cozy and welcoming atmosphere when it comes to service.  For drinks (and some high-end snacks), I suggest **Barents Cocktail &amp; Seafood Bar** (https://www.barents.lv/). While they also have a dedicated restaurant, in my opinion, the bar is better if you're looking to try something new. Just be sure to book the right place, as the bar and restaurant are located close to each other.  These are the first spots that came to mind. If I think of anything else, I'll update this comment!  **UPD1:** If you're looking for a casual pub to grab a drink, **The Thirsty Bulldog Sports Pub** offers a wide variety of IPAs and other interesting beers.

1gw8zin,Dylan77Drums,"Hello, I hope this comment helps you. I am an American living in Latvia. I am from Georgia, and I've been in riga for just over a year. I came here after graduating high school, and I'm a uni student here now. In my experience. Knowing latvian is not needed but makes things muuuuch easier. You can also learn Russian and be just as fine. But it might be frowned upon by some people. Knowing only English (like me) is fine as long as you're not talking to someone over 40. It is very difficult to do anything  that doesn't involve young people. Example: going to the doctor, the dentist, any government thing.... some places will have people who speak English, but if you have a friend here that can translate...keep them close lol. Jobs are a different subject. It's very very difficult to get a job here if you only speak English. It's possible, but difficult. It's definitely a better idea to have a job prior to coming that you can do remotely. DO NOT MOVE HERE WITHOUT A JOB! I'm saying this because I just recently got one after trying to find work for a year.....a year! But that's me, not you. The pay wage is very low in latvia compared to the US, so coming here with a remote job from the US will make you live like a king! As of now, the minimum wage is around 3 or 4 euros. The cost of living is low, but again, so is the pay. Just do a lot of planning and research. And if you have any specific questions, just ask me. Quick side note, the US embassy is latvia is a good place to look at for any opportunities.",8,1732188125.0,2024-11-21 11:22:05

It will not help you much to find job, etc.  We focus more and more on prioritizing Latvian language, new laws, initiatives, etc. Also - just check historical reddit posts, smth like ""I am tourist, I know English and Russian, which to use in LV/Riga/etc?

Meals are about ‚Ç¨10 at most. If you buy food for breakfast and dinner from the supermarket and then go out for lunch you'd be fine.",3,1731801317.0,2024-11-16 23:55:17
1gst6yd,darknmy,"Well a ""lunch offer"" is usually between 5 and 7. Old town is usually a bit more expensive, but 99% places are on the google maps under restaurants",1,1731784495.0,2024-11-16 19:14:55
1gst6yd,Loopbloc,Look for business lunch offers from 1100 to 1400. Those will be around 5 euros. Supermarkets like Rimi and Maxim also offer ready to eat munchies for around 3.5 to 5 euros. Mostly potato ü•î dishes. Coffee around 3 euros. Hesburger has some coffee deals.,2,1731864075.0,2024-11-17 17:21:15
1gst6yd,denisarnaud,"If you go to the employee restaurants like I think 77 kresli under city hall, etc. They have cheap and somewhat local food.  E.g.: 77 kresli has menus 4, 5.5, and 7 euros depending on size (menu picture from 26.09.2024). The issue is that such restaurants are only opened for lunch. Some others said either a supermarket or food at the central market. Good cheap options.",1,1731871244.0,2024-11-17 19:20:44
