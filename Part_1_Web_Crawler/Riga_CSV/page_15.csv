What's the exact location this picture was taken? If we knew the location, could look up when that street was last renovated and that might have info why this type of decoration was chosen. It's almost certainly a renovation within last 15 years.  If anyone has quick access to the book by Aivars Treicis about cobblestone of Riga, that book might have exact answer.

1g23vw1,FeedMeMoreOranges,Is from the old town. The street (of many) that I took the picture from is Maz√§ Jaunavu Iela.  I have no source that they are 120+ years old. It‚Äôs a guess. 150 years could properly be more of a correct answer. I have no idea.,1,1728886096.0,2024-10-14 06:08:16
1g23vw1,Onetwodash,"Ok, that's helpful. If we look up MazƒÅ Jaunavu in google streetview, it doesn't have this type of pavement but a fairly modern material instead (likely from 90s), and that's 2014 photo.  There have been A LOT of renovations in that general area repeatedly removing and replacing the cobblestones, sometimes replacing historic ones with modern stuff, then removing them to more 'historically accurate' look. I didn't  manage to find documentation for that street at the moment though and probably doesn't matter. That street also has extremely narrow and quite uneven sidewalks, so the arcs look a bit weird.  It's just meant to be a fan-shaped pattern. Super popular all across Europe for low traffic areas (as it's awful for narrow wheels) - just google sampietrini or european fan pattern. (Sampietrini actually refers to the type of bricks used in Rome, not the pattern and they're sometimes laid out in regular brick pattern instead - but you'll find plenty of sampietrinis in fan pattern as well, so that's a decent keyword to use.)   It kinda looks historical and supposedly is easy for bricklayer to adjust to uneven brick sizes, uneven surfaces and sudden ends/turns/corners and such while still maintaining some general semblance of the pattern, supposedly it also allows bricklayer to work faster, from inside of the arc out. Chopping granite stones in half is labor intensive and generates unhealthy particles, so pattern that allows to adjust to irregularities is good.  It's mostly used for decorative purposes as architect in charge of renovation in question decided it's a good idea, perhaps similar pattern was used there historically, perhaps it wasn't. And just look at Barona iela to see what happens when architect goes wild with ideas about bricks.. could be worse.   The pattern isn't great to drive across, but it's considered fine-ish for low pdestrian traffic.  The specific bricks used in the photo do in fact have surfaces that are less slippery when wet, but it's not going to help much when it's frozen over and anti-slipperiness isn't related to the pattern. Romes sampietrini are notoriously slippery even when in this pattern and Rome doesn't exactly see  half a year of ice and darkness.",2,1728904018.0,2024-10-14 11:06:58

1g1yvec,Capybarasaregreat,"Nah, it's a northern European thing, people also describe scandinavians and finns as being cold. It's not like cold is automatically always bad and warm is always good, just a cultural difference. People who live in a ""cold"" society still have friends and relationships with love and care. We're just not loud and extroverted in public, making friends with every person we come across. A well-traveled friend of mine considers his northern friends to be in general more reserved and calm and reliable friends for life, while southern friends can be very fun and adventurous, but not always reliable and floating in and out of his life. When making friends with us, as a foreigner, think of us as skittish cats whose trust you've got to earn a bit, whereas southern folks, stereotypically, are eager dogs always up for temporary or long-term friends.",1,1728802865.0,2024-10-13 07:01:05

1fvv9gs,Ok-Delivery-8286,"1. Idk is it what you are looking for but I would suggest neighbourhood.lv or Noktirne app.  2. I almost use no cash in Latvia, so I think you can just don‚Äôt think about this. The only thing is tips.  3. You can buy in Mobilly tickets for Riga Public Transport (Busses, trams and trolleys) and for trains too. If you buys tickets for the train for specific route it will be valid only for the specific train and specific route. For the busses there is the same system.  About Riga transport: the most popular option is to buy ticket for 90 minutes. Obviously this ticket is gonna work 90 minutes, and during this time you can activate this ticket (for another buses) as many times as you want. You can even activate this ticket on 89th minute and drive until the end of the route.  4. Go visit the Latvian National Library for the good view from the top of the building. It‚Äôs free, but I would suggest to call them and ask is the top floor is open.  Go visit Agenskalns and agenskalns market 5. Don‚Äôt limit yourself only on Riga‚Äôs Old Town. It‚Äôs more of a tourist trap now. Take a walk around the quiet center and other cities in Latvia. You have 5 days.
