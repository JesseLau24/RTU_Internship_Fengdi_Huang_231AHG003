The majority of inhabitants of Latvia are probably agnostic these days.  \&gt; Why should I be fooled by anyone?  Yes, indeed why? Why are you fooled by your pathetic communist government?  They have always hated the Chinese people, they have always been slaughtering the ordinary Chinese people, by the millions!

I suspect most church goers don‚Äôt pay particular attention, but once you know what you‚Äôre looking for and the religious significance, you notice.   If you wanted to observe the differences in how the alter is used in pre vs post Vatican II, you can go to (or find video of) a Traditional Latin Mass vs a Novous Ordo Mass.  As for the interior, it‚Äôs a beautiful structure but the decor is very plain which makes the alter the sole point of interest.  The why behind how a religious space is used is more interesting to me than the aesthetics.  Theres not much to look it, but that‚Äôs a lot of the point of the Reformation.
