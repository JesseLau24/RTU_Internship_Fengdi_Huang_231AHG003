I suspect most church goers don’t pay particular attention, but once you know what you’re looking for and the religious significance, you notice.   If you wanted to observe the differences in how the alter is used in pre vs post Vatican II, you can go to (or find video of) a Traditional Latin Mass vs a Novous Ordo Mass.  As for the interior, it’s a beautiful structure but the decor is very plain which makes the alter the sole point of interest.  The why behind how a religious space is used is more interesting to me than the aesthetics.  Theres not much to look it, but that’s a lot of the point of the Reformation.   So from that perspective, I appreciate what the space is communicating.  I went up to the tower at sunset and that was fabulous.  Cold, but great views.",2,1729448648.0,2024-10-20 18:24:08

1g6f30l,LuckySupport2005,As a student in Riga during the last few years I’m curious about the horror stories you’re talking about ?  Otherwise you should check ss.lv for your apartment,2,1729262322.0,2024-10-18 14:38:42
1g6f30l,alewifest,My friends have rented from facebook for example and have arrived to their apartment but the landlord has never arrived so they have left without a place to stay in. And one other has been a website where people have rented a place from but the place ended up being really sketchy to live as a woman. Of course these are a small percentage but I’m just being careful renting a place.,2,1729337926.0,2024-10-19 11:38:46
