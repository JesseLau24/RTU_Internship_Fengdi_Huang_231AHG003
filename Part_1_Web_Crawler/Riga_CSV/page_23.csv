1dhulzy,CastielTheFurry,"This depends where in Jūrmala you want to go. Majori has the main pedestrian street with access to the sea, but it is crowded during the summer. So check the map to see what you want to see and then you can find the closest train station name.  For Mobilly - just enter the origin name(Rīga) and destination, buy the ticket, usually one way or you can get it for return too. Tickets are usually for a train for a certain time. It’ll show you the departure times. Then on the train a conductor will ask you for the ticket and you show them the Mobilly QR code you’ll be  given after purchase. Trains to jurmala almost always leave exclusively from platform 3. The destination of the train is on the front carriage(they go to Tukums II or Sloka) and on screens at the platform.  At central station there are signs to the platform for the jurmala train.   Hope this helps!",1,1718623099.0,2024-06-17 11:18:19

1da9a3r,Alexandru1408,"Thank you for the recommendations!   With regards to food, we would be interested in local cuisine, but also some asian foods.  Also, could you provide more details with regards to the shooting ranges? What's the average price and where we might find one?",1,1717768995.0,2024-06-07 14:03:15
1da9a3r,Legion4800,"You're very welcome!   Local cuisine, I'd recommend Ala Pagrabs in old town. Further out you can try Lokāls Karbonādes.   Asian cuisine, you can find a decent Indian in Singh's, not much to ride home about Chinese/Thai/Korean. For Japanese, there is Shōyu. If you're looking for something a bit wild, try some Uzbekistani food at Taškenta.   Shooting ranges-wise, really depends how much you're willing to spend but bullets aren't cheap. Naughty Squirrel Hostel will sort out a group booking if you wanted to go, I think it ranges from 3 weapons (15 bullets) starting at something €30 each, going all the way up to €150 with a lot more obviously. There is also https://www.rigashoot.lv/ , a bit more pricey but very good range.",1,1717776215.0,2024-06-07 16:03:35
1da9a3r,Copper_pineapple,There are free walking tours leaving from outside St Peter’s most days. Really recommend. You should give them a generous tip at the end - they work really hard and speak perfect English.,2,1717783143.0,2024-06-07 17:59:03
1da9a3r,timetoreadt0,"Cozy eats reastaurant and 2eat falafel and hummus if you are in the mood for vegan/ veg food. The Corner house is really good, the guided tour is highly recommended. Don’t miss the Riga Cathedral as well, nice Orthodox Church. I did the walking tour from ‘Riga free tour’, was quite nice. Finally the old town is pretty cool.
