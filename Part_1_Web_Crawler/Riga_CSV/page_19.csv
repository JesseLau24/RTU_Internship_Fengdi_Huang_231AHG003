1emjcqd,TharixGaming,"october is kind of a shit time to come here in terms of weather since you don't get the nice warm flowery summer or the pretty snowy winter with all the decorations and christmas markets - but you're from scotland you'll be used to it  for bars, my top recommendation is folkklubs ala pagrabs - everyone recommends it, but trust me it's not overhyped. they have great latvian food (you HAVE to try latvian garlic bread aka ķiploku grauzdiņi) and a solid selection of drinks - not just beers, but also ciders and cocktails (which i appreciate, being a beer hater).   another decent place to get some drinks and food is ezītis miglā - which i guess is kind of the latvian version of wetherspoons? (though i like the vibe of ezītis way better) they have fairly cheap drinks and decent food, mainly the kind of food that's extra good when you're drunk - burgers, fried stuff, etc.  another place to check out is tallinas kvartāls - it's a bit hard to find since it's a courtyard that you have to go down an alley to get into, but there's a sign pointing to it. it's got a few different bars and street food-type restaurants, they have events there fairly often as well, definitely recommend checking it out.  for things to see, if y'all have a day to spare i recommend a day trip out to the town of sigulda - it's an hour away by train, and the trains go about every 1-2 hours from riga central station and cost 2.50 in each direction.   in riga, definitely go around the old town, if y'all want to learn more about our history i recommend the occupation museum, as well as the corner house (the old latvian HQ of the kgb, which has been converted into a museum)",3,1723294810.0,2024-08-10 13:00:10

If cafe/pub etc has this sign [https://www.uvitamins.lv/](https://www.uvitamins.lv/)  then you know they offer free water (usually tap water, sometimes the big water cooler water instead).  Right coast tap water is from underground sources.  It's as safe as bottled water, actually safer as it's tested more regularly and more thoroughly.  Left coast is overground water, but it undergoes extensive preparation and these days it's disinfected by ozone. Chlorine was used in the past (.. not this century I think, but people still remember 'it tasted terrible' and some still refuse to drink tap water because of that.). Either way, bacterial contaminantion in water in Riga are are not an issue outside of 'nearby local works' days when there is a local warning.  The only flavor concerns are high-ish iron content, especially from older pipes (that's what causes yellow staining in non-maintained bathrooms) and general water hardness (again, not a health issue, but tea and coffee extracts better in softer water - so you may want to filter or use bottled water if you want to appreciate every smallest nuance in your hot drink).

Of course you can save up and wait for sales but when a game costs 5-7 meals outside home or 0.5-1 week of food budget or 2 months of public transportation, for 1 game only, it makes pirating more tempting. The rent and bills are 600-800€ before you start to think that we got all that spare money left lying around lol.  I did a bad thingy, I got around the system to register an account and buy games through a cheaper country. I rarely want to play new games but when I do, I use that account to buy them. I wouldn't have to do that if the prices were tried to the country's average salary instead of location. Like, imagine South America having the same game prices as North America, that's location pricing for you.  Edit: I just realized this in Riga sub but whatever my point stands, if they ask 60€ from a country where average salary in 3k and 10$ from a county where average salary is 350$, I'll continue to feel discriminated.",1,1728320039.0,2024-10-07 16:53:59
