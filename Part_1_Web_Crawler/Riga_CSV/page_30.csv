17d66pk,[deleted],"No, idea what that place is from the other guy.  Basically, u have 4 major nightlife ares :  1. Old Town tourists drunky bars - Google maps: ROCK CAFE and all venues around it in 200-500m  2. Poshy clubby by the river - Google maps: KOYA lounge and all the venues around it in 100m  3. Alternative modern clubby youth: Google maps: M-DARBNICA and all the venues around it 50m  4. Same but different arty youth area with bars/clubs - Google maps: TALLINAS PAGALMS  I would try 3-4. They are pretty close to each other.

16wt6wc,TheDreadPirateJeff,"Barents was very good. I didn't get a chance to try Max Cekot as they were booked solid by the time I tried making reservations.  We also went to Restaurant John and it was quite good too.  They were pretty nice. It was Riga Restaurant Week and we didn't want their set course (which was a sampler, we wanted a full meal), and they warned us that ordering from the menu would take a while.  It did take a while, but was well worth the wait. Also, because we were so patient, we ended up with a free drink and free desert. The service was fantastic at both.  But what else are you looking for?  [Riviera](http://rivierarestorans.lv/en/) was also really good, as was [FERMA](https://fermarestorans.lv/lv/).    Theres a LOT of good, inexpensive food too.  [Tinto](https://www.tinto.lv/english) was a nice little quiet wine bar with a limited menu that was a nice change of pace for a quiet dinner.  LIDO is cheap, cafe style Latvian. The quality is good, the price fantastic.   This comes up as [Rockabilly House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8TWjfJc6WqN49m3D9) on Google Maps, but when went it was called ""The Stage by Two More Beers"" had a good beer selection and I very much enjoyed the burgers.  Mƒ´kla Bakeries (there are several) makes some great pastries and coffee. And there are a lot of good coffee shops all over central Riga and Old Town.  Another cozy Latvian place we liked (and went to twice) was [Province](https://www.provincija.lv/en/)",1,1705525856.0,2024-01-17 21:10:56
