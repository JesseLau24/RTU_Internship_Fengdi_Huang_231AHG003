1k3bpad,GGGMMM27,"I think that in some of the RTU dorms, the bathroom/toilet is shared between just two rooms ‚Äî like in a small hallway between them ‚Äî so it's not that bad. But I believe this setup is only in the newer dorms in ƒ∂ƒ´psala, if I'm not mistaken.  Also, as someone already mentioned here, check out Facebook groups ‚Äî when the semester ends, people often post room rental offers. However, keep in mind that sometimes the price can be almost the same as renting a whole apartment in another area.  You can also make your own post saying that you're looking for flatmates and want to share an apartment with someone.  This website is useful for checking apartment prices in different areas:   [https://www.ss.lv/lv/real-estate/flats/riga/filter/](https://www.ss.lv/lv/real-estate/flats/riga/filter/)  Edit: ff you look at the list, quite a few rooms in the RTU dorms actually have their own WC and even a shower.

1k20d1o,Even_Method_8719,"Google Riga hostels to find cheap accommodations, but outside of that, what you want to do depends on your interests.  Riga is known for its architecture -- dating back to the early 12th century in the Old Town, lots of Art Nouveau.  You'll be here in June, so theaters, the opera and such will be closed for the summer, but should you be here June 23, find yourself a Latvian, attach yourself to his or her hip and go to a traditional Summer solstice celebration.  Key elements:  Campfire and lots of beer.  We have a nice zoo, if that's your thing.  You can take boat rides on the river.  At the top of the Radisson Blu hotel is a bar with magnificent views all around town.  In other words, lots to do, and I hope you have a great time!",1,1744972150.0,2025-04-18 10:29:10

1k2br4s,Interesting_Agent269,"Riga is a fabulous place to go. Amazing city, lots of fun, great beer and food. Just be careful of women, who may be out of your league, approaching you in bars (especially Old Town). I have had two separate foreign male friends get their credit cards stolen/ charged at the bars for hundreds of dollars and one of them was drugged. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.   Ala Pagrabs is my go to spot for authentic food and beer. Tallinas Kvartals is an area outside of the Old Town that is usually very popular for bars and hanging out during summer. Nearby to that is One One which may have the electronic vibe youre going for.",3,1745019768.0,2025-04-18 23:42:48

1k2br4s,Affectionate-Dog8237,"Yes clearly, I've heard a lot of stories about that too. Girls in bars, strip clubs, etc.  It's a bit scary, but as u/AlternativeFluffy310  says, it's pretty much the case everywhere, but I've heard more about eastern cities, that's for sure :/ It doesn't put you in the best mood to have to be careful all the time and to have doubts.

1k2br4s,Interesting_Agent269,"If you want a day trip out of the city, Jurmala is a popular beach town with lots of restaurants. I prefer the quieter Vecaki beach area on the other side of Riga. As well, Sigulda is nice for hiking but a bit farther. These are all easily reachable via train.  In Riga, the cafe culture is lovely and ever growing. There are tons of amazing pastries and cakes as well. Old Town is the go to tourist area but walking around the Quiet Center and general Centrs area is great.   Old Town and Tallinas Kvartals are your most popular bar areas for tourists, with a few club type vibes for each (you will easily be able to spot them at night time). You might want to check out Laska V21 if you want to switch it up, they might have some type of concert or rave while youre there. For a bit classier, Gimlet Nordic Cocktail Bar is nice and you might meet more locals there.",1,1745069809.0,2025-04-19 13:36:49
