So yes, if someone looks like that then it can be enough reason to check them.  You maybe are local, idk. My answer might be more in general. I know in other countries people don't pay much attention to their own appearance, but here we do. For locals it's easy to recognize potential trouble makers by their appearance. Of course there are many who dress nicely and do bad stuff, but realistically no one here who looks like homeless would be just misunderstood hipster millionaire Balenciaga fan. I have seen enough tourists who get lured by suspicious people. As local I can see that and personally would even avoid talking with them on street. We also tend not to talk with random people on street, that also can be red flag of potential scam or trouble.   Not all homeless and random alcoholics need to be felt sorry for or that they would make great friends. Don't you feel sorry for people who get stolen from?

1j29gli,kiragami,"Some things I've not seen mentioned that are worth checking out are.   Museum of Latvian Occupation - it's somber but really gives you an understanding of what the Latvian people have endured and of their resilience.   Riga Black magic - Cozy cafe that serves deserts and cocktails incorporating the Latvian Liquor Balsam.   Ala Pagrabs - Cozy underground restaurant that often has live music. I recommend trying the grey peas as it's Latvia's national dish. Don't forget to try the Latvian style garlic bread sticks as well as they are wonderful.   Central Tirgus- Just south of the old town this features 3 blimp hangars converted to a market filled with tons of foods, restaurants and souvenir shops.   Latvian Academy of Sciences Observation deck - gives a great view of the city   A day trip to Sigulda is possible to see the Turaida Castle and to enjoy some hiking trails.
