14qrawj,LawlesssHeaven,"Welp. I'm a guy in my mid 20's and from my female friends words when I leave they get hit on pretty much instantly in every place we've been to in old town.  You might try Andrejostas kvartƒÅls, seems to be one of nicer places currently. Edit: most places are safe and it all comes down to what music and amount of people you want to enjoy",3,1688508059.0,2023-07-04 22:00:59
14qrawj,afoolremainsane,"Ah, is it a bit like that? Have they said anything about if they let them be if they say no, or are the (I assume) guys very insistent? I asked some coworkers before, and they did recommend Old Town, but they are also all guys, so...   Andrejostas kvartƒÅls looks cool. I put that on my list of potential places. Thanks! :D  That sounds good, I guessed most places would be safe, but it's been some time since I went clubbing, and I haven't been doing it in Riga before, so it's better to ask.",1,1688580630.0,2023-07-05 18:10:30
14qrawj,LawlesssHeaven,"Old town is great but was a little bit ruined by not so cultural immigrants. It all comes down to culture, locals aren't really insistent but some foreigners can be.   Usually when I go clubbing with friends we just roam old town starting from some more popular places like rock cafe and then see how it goes based on the amount of people and music played.   I've got a hyper active female friend that just likes going out alone and she seems to be doing fine so you should be to :D  But yeah, we've got plenty of tourists and students in the old town so there is quite a high chance you'll find someone with the same energy :D",1,1688581302.0,2023-07-05 18:21:42

That has happened to me before, and I was not a fan.  Ah, yeah, going alone can make it a bit less enjoyable I think, so I prefer finding a place that is okay to start with :D  Haha, sounds good!

When I checked now, it looked like some people had missed that before, but now I know!  Sinners Club does look very cool! (Online, at least, haha). List of potential nightclubs it goes :D  Writing ""Peldu Street"" without specifying Riga first sent me to LiepƒÅja. For a moment there, I thought, ""eh. that's a little too far travelling for dancing ..."" xD  Thursday to Saturday sounds plenty enough. I will also do other stuff besides clubbing, so that sounds good.  Already when we went out in our early 20s, my friends found me a bit weird for that.

142t25r,Infamous_Ad1317,"Greetings!  Welcome!  Here are some helpful tips and suggestions for your stay in Riga:  1. Upon your arrival at the airport, consider booking a 'Bolt' taxi instead of a regular one to avoid any potential overcharging. You can download the 'Bolt' app, which also offers the option to pre-book your ride.  2. Latvians are generally friendly, although they tend to be more reserved. However, the younger generation is more relaxed and outgoing.  3. When it comes to grocery shopping, Rimi, Maxima, or Lidl are all good options with reasonable prices.  4. Riga is generally a safe city. However, it's advisable to avoid the square outside 'Orego Mall' and Riga Central Station, as there tends to be a high number of intoxicated individuals in those areas.  5. The weather in Riga is similar to that of Scandinavian countries. Summers are short, and winters can be extremely cold. Personally, I find the weather enjoyable here.  6. If you're looking for an apartment to rent, many people use 'www.ss.lv' as a popular platform. You can also explore Facebook Marketplace for additional options.  7. For sightseeing and exploring the city, I recommend using Google Maps. It will provide you with a wealth of information about various places of interest.  8. During peak rush hour, crossing the bridge by car or bus can take approximately 15-20 minutes. However, if you opt for a tram or one of the many electric scooters available (such as Bolt or Tulu), the journey will likely only take 2-3 minutes.  9. Lastly, I advise you to immerse yourself in the local culture, make new friends, enjoy your time in this beautiful city, and, of course, study hard.  Wishing you all the best during your stay! üòä",4,1686091439.0,2023-06-06 22:43:59

J≈´rmala: Has a full street with just restaurants and a beautiful white sand beach just 10-15 minutes walking distance from the train station. Ticket prices just under 2‚Ç¨ per person one direction just 1 hour outside Riga.   Cƒìsis: Lovely town with a old medieval center and a large medieval castle very immersive experience. Cool cafes and restaurants around and a national park around the city. Trains ticket price 3.50‚Ç¨ per person. 2 hours outside Riga.   Sigulda: Nice small town on the edge of a national park. You can ride down a Olympic bobsleigh, visit 2 castle ruins 1 inside the town and 1 outside (a bit of a hike through the national park) and amazing views. It also has a cool market with restaurants called ""JƒÅ≈Üa tirgus""  Ticket price just under 2‚Ç¨ for the train.   RundƒÅlƒì Palace aka Versailles of the North is a nickname that is has held for a looong time. It's a very beautiful Palace with the most beautiful French garden. You can get there by taking public transport like a bus. Or a tour bus, but naturally thst costs more.   If you wish to do one of these then I recommend you download Mobilly or Pasa≈æieru Vilciens app to see all train time tables and to purchase tickets. (It's cheaper online.)  About restaurants in Riga... Someone already made a good list, but I can also recommend:   K≈´kotava they have nice pastries, salads, snacks etc. (Don't be confised that the place is split in two)  Mƒ´kla: Good coffee, amazing pastries and sandwiches.  Boo the burger: Amazing juicy burgers! And they literally serve champagne with each burger. üò≠  Street Burger: Amazing juicy burgers.  Sh≈çyu: Japanese restaurant that literally has 96% 5 star votes! The food is gorgeous and just fenomenal... The prices are higher though. For example a large noodle bowl is 14-18‚Ç¨  These restaurants that I listed are very trendy.  As for places to visit in Riga...  Of course the old town.  City centre and the ""Quiet centre"".  Alot of cool buildings you can enter in Riga old town... Too many to list, but I recommend you get maps at the tourism information office.  Open air museum if you want to see how Latvians lived in each region of the country for hundreds of years. (They literally transported real buildings into one area. It is also the 2nd oldest ethnographic open-air museum in the world.)  Central market.  Railway museum if youre into old trains.  National library.",5,1684908707.0,2023-05-24 06:11:47

13k3f7o,karums_varna,There is ice hockey championship in Arena Riga so they had to move the concert to Me≈æaparks when they postponed.,1,1684343837.0,2023-05-17 17:17:17

13k3f7o,karums_varna,Thanks! :) Usually it's hard to find a parking space. I would suggest to park somewhere else and go to Me≈æaparks by bus. There will be extra buses from and to city centre before and after the concert.,1,1684344122.0,2023-05-17 17:22:02

13j0m9l,hansolox1,For recommendations please use the search bar. This question has been asked many times before here.  For transportation you can get a 3 day ticket for 8EUR for all public transport or a 5 day one for 10EUR. Taxis are also relatively cheap within city if you use apps like Bolt and such.  Cards are accepted nearly everywhere and are the preferred payment option of most of the locals. Don‚Äôt remember last time I ran into somewhere where cards weren‚Äôt accepted. If markets are your thing they might be cash only.,2,1684237691.0,2023-05-16 11:48:11

13iah6e,videoalex,"I almost fell for this! It‚Äôs a scam.   They take to a bar, they order something but the bar only sells that wine by the bottle-the bottles of wine are VERY expensive.   It‚Äôs all a scam. I told my date I would t buy her drink because I just met her and she freaked out on me.",2,1684189584.0,2023-05-15 22:26:24
13iah6e,Leidenfrost1,"Ok I'm not a Riga native, but I'll share what I can:     1.) I stayed in Riga for 4 weeks last year and I never heard about any scams like that going on, but that's not saying it doesn't happen.  2.) You could ask someone that works with tourists/visitors for more info - like someone that works at a hostel. They would likely know more.  3.) If you meet her, you could always suggest going to a different place for drinks. Plenty of places to choose from in Riga. For a first date, something easy and public is always a good idea.     And as always, trust your instincts. Anything too good to be true usually is. Last year when I was in Riga, someone I met at a bar one night started being a little too friendly and buying me shots and drinks. It felt like it might be some kind of scam so I just left. It's a really boring story because nothing happened, but that's the point. Sometimes you have to trust your instincts and turn it into a boring ""non-story"".",1,1684173644.0,2023-05-15 18:00:44
