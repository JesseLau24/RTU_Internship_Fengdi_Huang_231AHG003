16magyp,HighFlyingBacon,I do not know the fees for international schools and I don't know if you even need international schools since your children are very young and would adapt to anything quite fast.

16magyp,Adventurous-Guard312,"Intl school (english-speaking) is around 8k€/y/kid. Baltic countries have a very high inflation (&gt;20% last year), so we're on track to have the priciest food in the EU. Most food is imported anyway.  Also, the health system here is pretty dire, it's the country with the lowest life expectancy in the EU for a reason. IT industry is not particularly developed, there are companies, but it's nowhere near what you'll find in Estonia. You'd be better off staying in the UK, and work remote for a US company.  Also, you need to factor in the winter here (expect 600€+ gas bills/mo), and the likely need to get a car (you can't use your UK car here as we're driving on the other side of the road).As a side note, why Latvia?

16lumpl,yung_lank,I lived and saved money @ 1k a month net. You should be more than good. Airbaltic offers relatively cheap flights throughout Europe. Would be a good salary to live with opportunities to travel throughout Europe. A few times a year there is a sale with airbaltic where you can get really cheap flights. It will be a little bit more expensive to get to the main touristy parts of Europe (outside of Scandinavia) but flights will be there. Trains will be there in a few years hopefully via rail baltica. Traveling in Latvia is also quite cheap compared to other parts of Europe.

Also, protip, set up a Tinder account, photoshop yourself on board of a Porsche, while skydiving in Dubai, and whatever wealth attribute you think of, buy a boost when you arrive, and get laid. Of course, don't lie, but you'll probably have a more interesting trip !",1,1695775440.0,2023-09-27 00:44:00

1658jjx,filmmakermusician,"Yeah, because no one would ever think of going to a nightclub to look for girls. Going there to get wasted on alcohol is so much more healthy than flirting, isn't it?

I also went to Valhalla nightclub, which was a more generic club playing more pop and EDM type stuff. Again, a mixed crowd.  That was on the Friday and Saturday. I heard it's quieter on the other days.",4,1693395416.0,2023-08-30 11:36:56
