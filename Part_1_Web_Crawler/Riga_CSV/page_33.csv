15carma,koalaboala,I think this could give you a good idea- it's different supermarket chain weekly offers  https://akcijubuklets.lv/  Transport monthly pass is 30 EUR.

154v8ey,Izzy_y,"Stayed in Riga for a week a year or 2 ago and found a lot of people spoke English. Everything was in English, Russian and Latvian.

14xxym8,The_Lettonian,"Flew out of Riga recently on a 7am flight and and the non-priority line for checking in and checking bags was quite long. The check-in desks opened at 5am so there was an immediate line at security once that started flowing, even the security line itself wasn't too long. You *might* be able to make it work with the bus if you have a priority boarding/security and/or no checked bags but there'll be a line at security already....honestly I'd say just take the bolt if you have any checked luggage and/or want to be safe.   For me, I didn't have priority boarding but made it to my plane with a bit of stress but without running, and I got to the airport before 5. I was still in line to check in at 6 and would have missed my flight if it was that early.",1,1689196708.0,2023-07-12 21:18:28

Had some trouble with my credit card using it the first time too so by the time I got a car, I didn't arrive at the airport til 5:11. There was a huge line for air Baltic going across the terminal. Lufthansa, my airline, has zero line. Security said estimate ""1 minute"".  I went to the priority line but this actually took longer as the lady wanted to see my frequent flyer card so I had to find it in my app since no one has ever asked for it.  The guy in front of me got offended that the agent asked him to show down as he was forcing his trays through the xray and made a big scene asking for a manager to complain further.  I stopped by the lounge and got there at 5:25. So the bus probably would have been fine assuming it was on time and the conditions didn't change. But payment an extra 8EUR for some peace is mind on a multiple connection flight back to the US isn't too bad.",2,1689217039.0,2023-07-13 02:57:19
