1e83kas,DirtyDerpina,I've been going to Lashviii for a couple years now. I think they are pretty reasonable. The lashes last like 4 weeks for me and I never had issues with quality or hygiene or anything. You can check their IG and also individual artists' IG pages and then book online with whoever you like the most. Oh and they all speak english!,2,1721538762.0,2024-07-21 05:12:42

1e7cluu,StronkAsHell,"Did I say that any of them are gone?  I used to live here as a kid 25 years ago and it was JUST HORRIBLE. I enjoy living here now, walking around at night is safe. It will take another 10 for the cleansing to be completed, but its already incomparable.   It still has all of these problems, but they are rapidly improving. Ziedondarzs no longer has the homeless/drug issue in the park and toilets (I would say that it has become my favorite place in the whole city). Only hookers can be seen on lienes iela, im not sure about the loud voices, maybe im deaf. Even in 2018 all the issues were multiple times worse. Also keep in mind that the area become in demand before they become clean - nobody wants to buy peak value properties. And the new local residents are fighting to clean the area thats why there is progress. Once they are clean they are overpriced and are no longer interesting for the young people so we work on this community right now. You can see it by the huge amount of people in the local biedribas, taking part in events, markets, initiatives etc. Just check the real estate price growth charts from any company and the amount of deals closed to understand the demand (most also have a growth % indicated). This is not klusais centrs, this is a hipsters place, but you statement sound like they come from someone who does not live here, just went through the are and judged based on what they saw on the street that day. Come to some events, go to Kuure, sunbathe in Ziedondarzs, have a burger at OAKa, a beer at krokodils, play some board games at the ezitis down the road and you might just get a little taste of why we young people love it here. Klusais centrs is a place where all the dirty money is parked so of course it is incomparable.  P.S. just to give you the pricing growth understanding - I bought the apartment in 2018 for 58 000 and I am going to sign paperwork to sell it tomorrow for 115 000 (the deposit is already in my hand). And what am I doing with that money? Buying another horrible, destroyed apartment under market value here that is owned by some alcoholics or drug addicts (just 2x bigger than mine), repair it and make it a home.

1e7cluu,Tsukutsukuboshi,Thank you for your answer and the map! The Soviet era blocks are public housing nowadays or the inhabitants pay a rent or own them?,0,1721456960.0,2024-07-20 06:29:20
1e7cluu,[deleted],"No public housing there except for a few newly built (around 2010) separate commie block style welfare housing. Those inhabitants often abuse their free flat and surroundings, not unusual to secretly rent it out for money, alcohol is often involved.¬†    The regular commie block house owners are all private persons but often rent them out instead of living there themselves. Those were built to house the massive USSR-backed immigration from USSR states (inclusing Russia) as a plan to establish total dominance and make Latvia a part of Russia by all means (Latvians almost became a minority in own country as a result). Good thing USSR collapsed around 1990 and part of the immigrants went home but many stayed - enough to cause headache still today.    Ethnic Latvians were lower caste and didn't typically receive flats in those Riga commie blocks - it was the Russian-speaking immigrants. So these neighborhoods are heavily Russian-speaking. As these blocks were built in 2nd part of 20th century¬† up until early 90's, many inhabitants acquired them for quite small money after USSR ceased to exist and later left them as an inheritance to their¬† kids/grandkids, which do not always want to live there and rent out/sell them, thus having a bit more of Latvians settle those blocks.",2,1721539656.0,2024-07-21 05:27:36
1e7cluu,Tsukutsukuboshi,"Thank you for your answer. After all this years are still separeted Russians a Latvians? I mean during the last 40 years they didn't mixed (marriage, friendship etc)?",1,1721543456.0,2024-07-21 06:30:56
1e7cluu,[deleted],"There are some marriages, friendships and so on but a very big part of Russians (especially the old ones) live in their separate world preferring not to interact with anything Latvian beyond bare necessity. News in Russian (often - straight from Kremlin), newspapers, pro-russian political parties voicing Kremlin narrative, Russian schools where teachers formally have to teach everything in Latvian but in reality only speak broken one themselves when an inspection arrives. That boils down to both attitude and intellectual capabilities, encouraged by meak politics keeping Russian schools and not enforcing any integration.    As I said - Latvians were considered a lower caste, called names and ""fascists"" in USSR due to resisting Russian occupation and objecting Russian atrocities in WW2 and in every dispute anything Russian was right by default, up to the secret service (KGB). That led to the Russians demonstratively calling Latvian as ""language of the dogs"" not worth learning, consequences of which we still see today, also in the aforementioned schools as the parents and grandparents often were the ones exhibiting such attitude. The more progressive, intellectually developed and reasonable part of the Russians send their kids to Latvian schools, they grow up knowing both languages well, integrate well, usually don't repeat Kremlin narrative or cause any trouble. The more stubborn, less intellectually gifted part of the Russians just want to live their life with everything Russia in their daily lives but still enjoying being in Europe. They have a comfortable life with most businesses speaking Russian to them.    TL;DR: we try to get along but there's way too large immigration forced upon Latvia and ingrained propaganda to deal with in one generation. Language learning is a big factor. The young ones are better unless they live in pro-Kremlin families. Speaking just Russian is usually a telltale sign of having pro-Kremlin views and having below average education, thus reducing any chances of mixing.",1,1721550003.0,2024-07-21 08:20:03
1e7cluu,OriginalWin8580,"As long as Russians are treated as second class in Latvia, they will never truly want to learn your language.   When the USSR was in process of collapsing, my mother worked at the VEF manufactory.   She told me, that once some latvian co-worker called her a Russian pig. What kind of attitude do you expect towards your country and language after this?  My father worked in this country and paid taxes all his life. Now he receives a poverty pension that is only enough for food and bills.  Here's what I say.  Most of the districts, hospitals, schools and clinics in Riga were built by, as you say, ""occupants"". What did native Latvians built in almost 35 years of independence? This is a rhetorical question.  All this time our goverment fuck around with Latvian language and did nothing besides that.  Soviet infrastructure are slowly failing apart. Where will we live? In those overpriced 1-room dog burrows in new buildings?  Develop your country, make strong economy, social security and respect for all nations and races, and maybe one day people will want to learn your language.

It's been going downhill for a while the biggest blow sustained was 2008. I don't think they ever fully recovered from it.   Plus there is another big issue, which is not really being addressed and it's causing all these abandoned houses issue you mentioned. In 1991 the law passed where the properties were denationalised and returned to the owners, whom they belonged to in 1940, or their heirs. This resulted in large number of properties with people living in them belonging to people that may have never been to Latvia and all of a sudden became landlords. However as anyone would agree owning something vs maintaining it has a difference. The maintenance costs and restoration costs are super high, so that people that own it may not have the ways and means to repair it. So thus there is this sad view in many parts of the city and since there is no legal way to force owners to repair their properties - you see what you get.",2,1721643004.0,2024-07-22 10:10:04

1e7cluu,ovenbabyh,"1) As someone who has lived in Riga my entire life, I've always felt like the left bank of the river (opposite from downtown), with the exception of ""Klusais centrs"" and Old town is the wealthy side, for example, most of my relatives/friends from my neighbourhood in the suburbs of the right bank, who got married and had kids and found a stable income moved there, to the new/renovated buildings.   2) Every neighbourhood has its suspicious persons and buildings, but the ones that are more noticeable (Kengarags, Maskavas fortstate, Ilguciems, Bolderaja, Zolitude, Imanta, Plavnieki, Purvciems, parts of Jugla and Mezciems, and many many more neighbourhoods) have the lowest rent prices due to the apartment buildings which were built in the 60s-70s-80s for families of factory workers(you couldn't just buy an apartment like that, even if you had the money), and were built to live in for 20 - 30 years max. Most of the landlords are old people, and don't raise the rent prices up to the clouds, that's why they are appealing to criminals and junkies. For example, my grandpa got an apartment in Mezciems in 1980., and after his death 2 years ago, we sold it for a relatively low price. The new owners paid in cash with paper money, think of it what you want.   3) After the collapse of the USSR, there was a huge wave of the so-called ""privatisation"" when all kinds of buildings and factories were bought for a relatively low price. Some original owners still own them, some sold them for a bigger price, and the new owners either don't want or can't afford to do anything with their properties, that's why they are abandoned.",1,1721586762.0,2024-07-21 18:32:42

1e6e9iv,flapcaek,"ƒ∂emeri national park and open air museum are great choices!  If you're looking for things to see in Riga, I would probably suggest the Latvian National Museum of Art which was refurbished recently. And if you're interested in architecture, it borders with a part of the city which has many Art Nouveau buildings in one place.  The old town of Riga might be an interesting place to wander around as well.  If it's the end part of September, give Sigulda a shot. You might get a glimpse of the ""golden autumn"".   If not, that is probably the first suggestion everyone will give you either way, as you can hike on both sides of the river Gauja valley and see some great nature sights + if you go to Turaida, you can visit the castle as well.  If you're going in the direction of Sigulda, Lƒ´gatne is another destination you might consider. You can check out [https://www.ligatnesdabastakas.lv/home/](https://www.ligatnesdabastakas.lv/home/) Lƒ´gatnes nature trails and the town of Lƒ´gatne itself.  Depending on how far from Riga you're willing to go, there are many great nature hiking trails of different difficulties. I would suggest using the map of [dodies.lv](http://dodies.lv) which has listed many trails, however it seems to be only in Latvian so it might be difficult to figure it out.  These are just some suggestions from the top of my head, but you might try posting in r/latvia as it's a larger community than Riga one and you might get more responses there.  Hope you have a great time here!",3,1721329094.0,2024-07-18 18:58:14
1e6e9iv,Sableye09,"What are you into? Are you only staying in Riga? And for how long?   There is definitely things to see, but it depends on what you're into. Partying? Fancy places? Culture? History? Physical activities? Weather should be nice enough though.",1,1721324895.0,2024-07-18 17:48:15

1e6e9iv,Sableye09,"Nice. Since your friend is retiring I guessed it was an older crowd, but you never know what people are up to hahah  For history, I'd really recommend checking out the occupation museum, it's a really nice exhibition, with or without a tour. It gives some great insight into recent history and what Latvia had to endure. There's also a lot of things to see around it like the Tris Brali, the Opera House or the Freedom Monument. If you want to go even further back in history, while it's not the best place for that specifically, the Jewish museum is also quite nice and digs a bit deeper. (And while I'm biased for the next one, since I used to work there) The ≈Ωanis Lipke museum just across the river is also great, is gorgeously designed and tells a great story. I would recommend a tour for 19 people though.  For physical activities, both of my suggestions are weatherdependent and require a train ride, but if you have the time to take a train out to Sigulda, it's great for a little day trip hike, and also has some interesting sights to see, the sandstone cave in particular is a cool piece of history. If you have the time, check out Jurmala, in my opinion the most gorgeous beach around Riga, and there are some nice places for food around it too.  Ala Pagrabs, Folkklubs is great for a big beer selection and more traditional food, it is a bit dark though. Same goes for Rozengrals, though it has a more medieval touch to it. There are other places too, but let me know if you want to know more, or more about what.   Lived in Riga for 10 months, Sept-June 2023, so these places should still be fine, and I hope they are kind of what you're looking for :)",5,1721328220.0,2024-07-18 18:43:40

1e29p9t,Onetwodash,"These guys [https://www.facebook.com/SALASMAIZEofficial/](https://www.facebook.com/SALASMAIZEofficial/) used to make the only sklandrausis I've ever tried in Riga that was nice, and not an annual reminder of 'oh, right, I hate this'. Whether they're still active, whether their skalndrausis master is still with them - I have no idea. But maybe they reply on facebook or something. Thing is, sklandrausis can be really good. The stuff in Sky and, unless they've changed, also in Kalnciema tirgus is downright awful.  Kuldƒ´ga is pretty and quite worth a daytrip.  Other stuff to try:  coldsoup/beetsoup/pinksoup. Honestly any random bistro if that's still august. Might have to rely on Lido by september, it's a summer food. If you're offered potato with it RUN and report Lithuanian occupants at nearest police station.  Potatoes with herring and cottage cheese.  Buksti≈Üputra - milk based barley porridge with potatoes, eaten with cooked bacon and caramelized onions. MrBobs Bistro @ ƒåiekurkalns makes a very good one, might not be as good in their  franchise locations. Can be randomly found at other bistros or fancier places.  Maizes zupa - a desert based on rye bread with dried fruits. Eaten with milk and whipped cream.  Smoked fish with cheese (and, optionally -  onions/garlic/bellepepper if you like those). Location - wherever you can get freshest, supermarkets usually have few days old. It's not bad, but it's not as great. Sometimes there are stalls next to the big malls selling fresher stuff. Same in some of the local farmers markets in plenty of places in the city carry fresh stuff few times a week. Or if you drive along seacoast early enough in the morning. There are signs, you'll notice.  Eels in tea jelly - national delicay for when you want to get extra fancy. Search this in the market.  Rƒ´gas ≈°protes - national tapa for when you do really want jellied eels but you don't like the idea of actually eating eels and would rather have a healthy fatty fish instead.. It's hot smoked sprats in oil, canned (glas jar option also available) that keeps forever until you open the packaging. You put a fish (or 2-3) on a slice of bread and spread it out with a fork. Use bread to soak up oil remaining in a can in the end if you wish.  Open faced sandwiches (that we really should advertise way more, nordics and slavs do, not sure why we don't). Some traditional combos that may be offered in few places  or you can  just buy groceries and make your own - White bread-butter-tomato-salt-pepper-red onions. White bread-butter-lightly salted salmon-salt-onions-dill-lemon. Black bread-butter-soft boiled egg-salted herring.   Sour-cream based salad. 'Rosols' - sometimes renamed to 'Gaƒºas salƒÅti' or 'cepe≈°a salƒÅti'. It's local version of what Spanish call Insalada russa. 'Siera salƒÅti' - cheese, garlic, carrots, sour cream. 'Valmieras salƒÅti' - cheese, eggs, pickles, mayo, sour cream. 'Siƒºƒ∑e ka≈æokƒÅ' aka 'herring in a coat'.  - layers of herring, beetroot, onions and few other ingredients I can't currently remember. It's another pink food.  In few months it's apple time so just get a square of applie pie, 'ƒÅbolu plƒÅtsmaize'.  And yeah, get speƒ∑a pƒ´rƒÅdzi≈Üi. Also try 'KƒÅrums'.",1,1720974983.0,2024-07-14 16:36:23
