1drjqnh,[deleted],"If you have business North side from Opera house then underground ""Jēkaba kazarmas"". Which is NOT the same thing as ""Jēkaba arkāde"".  The Daugava side of Vecrīga is ""11. novembra krastmala"". That's near Anglican church, parking on street side. I suggest using the small part of it along Anglican church, right between ""Poļu gāte"" and ""Bīskapa gāte"". Same rate but more quiet and parallel parked and less chances of getting your doors dinged.  Third option: if you are not confused by \~5eur/h rate then drive right into Vecrīga and leave on any street where that's not forbidden.  Fourth: there's a big parking lot on Kungu/Peldu street corner. Rate was IIRC 2eur/h, paid in cash.",1,1720020081.0,2024-07-03 15:21:21

Teenagers sharing a hotel room with parents isn't exactly cool lol, not to mention their dad(me) can snore, so it'd be good to get their own bedroom within the same hotel room, if possible.   No idea why Riga has suddenly appealed to me, but I'm assuming there'll be more than enough to keep everyone entertained for a few nights.
