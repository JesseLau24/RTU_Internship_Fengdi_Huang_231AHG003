But then someone sued over preferential treatment and now anyone can pick up passengers at the airport. Redcab and Baltic Taxi had their own second line for a while but now simply stopped showing up.  So I guess you experienced good ol fashion democratic fairness.

The tours are done by a beer sommelier and they include a personalised tour of 3-4 breweries / taprooms and you get to try 12 different local beers taking in to account your preference and knowledge. I'm not sure you could get a tour on those dates since it's around the holiday's and most places will be shut on the 25th but it's worth giving them a ring.
