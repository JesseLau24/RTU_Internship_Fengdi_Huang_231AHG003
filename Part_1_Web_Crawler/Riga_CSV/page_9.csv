Like maybe if look for one you can find a too strict church or something, but I don\`t now such. Does that mean that Riga is 100% safe? No, idiots are everywhere and no place on Earth is safe from them. But it is definitely not in the nature of local people to care about people around and their lives (too introverted).

1hxewwe,Historical-Energy144,From memory (which is hazy üòµ‚Äçüí´) some of the beers at Nurme were in excess of 5 euros but they have a massive selection. At 3 men in a boat their house beer was 3.50 euros for a 500ml serving,2,1736520952.0,2025-01-10 14:55:52

1hx9n4l,GarlicEnvironmental7,"Old Town is full of good bars and restaurants, but it isnt cheap! Well, it's still cheaper than London but expensive for Latvia. Get outside the centre and everything is at least 50% cheaper.      Lido is a great place for cheap food. The one in the centre has an amusement park and big windmill but there are a few around the city.      The central market is also a great place for central cheap eats.     Use the tram to get about. It's about ‚Ç¨1 per trip and super easy. Get a train out to Majori, Jurmala and check out Jomas Street and the various national parks.      Download the Bolt app (Latvian Uber) and get a cab to the Kemeri Bog walk.     I've just come back from a Twixmas break and loved it. If you're lucky enough to get snow, there are several ski resorts within 1hr of the city.     Enjoy!",3,1736421358.0,2025-01-09 11:15:58

1hx9n4l,001Piffi,"really depends on what type you are.. if you like getting into trouble then just stay in old town like most british lads do (idk if you are british) when it comes to bars.   Food: Late Night Munchies, Lido, Ala Pagrabs, Street Pizza, Space Falafel, and a bit more random: Himalaya Resturant   Bars: In my opinion only boring places in old town. Cheapest beer is in Ezitis Migla, many locations around the city. Piana Vyshnia, Gimlet, Ala Pagrabs, Gauja, Krokodils, Radisson Sky bar. Just to name a few.  Touristy stuff: Occupation museum, KGB museum, national library, Vecaki and Jurmala, Central Market, maybe Hockey/Basketball match.",1,1736422913.0,2025-01-09 11:41:53
