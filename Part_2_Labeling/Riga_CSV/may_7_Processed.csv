Indian Raja, Laims Cafe, Wok n Curry, and the new Curry Express place on Čaka/Tallinas corner are far better options for Indian food in Rīga.    I do get behind Boo the Burger, Riis, and Rione though. They all make great food.",2,1747866502.0,2025-05-21 22:28:22,false,restaurant review of Indian food options in Rīga,negative
