Usually all found items end up at the police, but they may take the long route. First, calmly look trough your items at home. It happens. In panic mind may not be so clear. Make sure you now when was the last time you were sure that the wallet was with you. If you lost it in the middle of the street and somebody found it, the may turn it to the police tomorrow, because today is Sunday. If you lost it close to the bus stop and someone found it, they might have turned it to the community transport lost and found department. If by bus station you mean the Riga bus station, they have an info center, where you can ask about found items. Also usually people post about lost and found items in special facebook groups, check groups dedicated to the Kengarags and nearest areas and also general ""pazaudēts"" un ""atrasts"" groups. Also, if I found a wallet with foreign id in it, as an option I would bring it the consulate of that country if it would be closer than the police station. If there was also a local student id, people might turn it to your university.

Also I’m not saying that the whole country is run down, but there is an overall feeling of it being really old and kind of crumbling and empty. Sometimes i drive through villages that are just abandoned.  The emigration started with the 2008 recession and hasnt really ceased. I think a huge portion of our population leaves the country each year, and it is predicted that Latvia is going to reach under 1 million inhabitants by the end of the century (its currently around 1,9 million).   Most people go to the UK, but also a lot of other places in Europe such as Germany, Poland and Iceland, and quite a few to Scandinavia. Theres not a lot of social support from the government and the jobs are scarce and wages are poor. It’s quite hard sometimes to make a living so many people plan to move out the country and return later (and then never do). I lived in the UK for most of my life but very frequently visit my homeland, and perhaps will move back one day, but most likely not. The opportunities provided in other countries are huge, and Latvia just doesnt have those resources or chances. The universities arent the best and the education system is a bit wobbly (i did go to school there for a few years in my early teens). Also a lot of things are closing down, like hospitals and schools. All this means that Latvia is just slowly disappearing sadly",2,1746513545.0,2025-05-06 06:39:05

In the last 10 years, average salaries have gone up by 120% (more than doubled). Adjusted for prices, in the last 10 years GDP per capita has doubled.   Adjusted for PPP, Latvia's GDP per capita is only about 20% lower than Japan or New Zealand. It is 30% lower than the UK. So yes, it is poorer - but not really very dramatically so.   Countryside is empty and getting emptier. Most young people don't really have much interest in agricultural jobs, and Latvia is not capable of subsidizing agriculture to the same level as Western Europe. It is also a pretty large country with low population density - 50% larger than Switzerland or The Netherlands, so it is not always possible to commute to work.

There are walking trails through the forest, a walkable pier with a lighthouse, remnants of old military bunkers and fortifications (19th and 20th century) that can be freely explored. Also, an old shipwreck (""Lady Cotlin"") that can be seen from the beach. Mangalsala is quite popular with locals, but I doubt that many tourists have time to visit it.    Likewise, Vakarbuļļi &amp; Daugavgriva offers a beach, an old fortress and a sculpture park by the Lielupe river. They have 20+ big art objects made by a local artist just standing by the river.    If you go to Mezciems, you can visit the Motor museum (they have a good collection of antique cars), and next to it is a race track, which is open to public. When no races are taking place, you can freely walk the whole track, and many locals use it for jogging and cycling. To make things more interesting, the track is actually located next to a forest with a lake in the middle of it. So you can take a step off the track to chill by the lake or wander through the forest at your leisure.",4,1746355934.0,2025-05-04 10:52:14

187,1kef0ce,Impressive-Shake-820,"For a good restaurant I would say O Sole Mío. We had pizza and tiramisu and it was delicious.  For a quick running lunch, big bad bagels. We aged them while walking around Riga.  For drinks with a view checkout the food court top floor and balcony of Galerija Centrs (it’s a shopping mall but has a bar and food hall with good decent priced pizza and a rooftop view) alternatively the skyline bar at the radisson blue conference + spa. They also have a football themed cocktail right now and do have a dj on Saturday nights (at least that’s when we went)   For a pastry the basque Cheesecake in Mikkla Bakery.  For a activity you can walk along Bastejkalna Park and do the canal tour as you suggested or one we saw a lot of people doing is cycling drinking tours. They have a table and a guide who steers but we saw a lot of these.  I would also say Riga is a beautiful city with amazing parks, if your going for that and not cheap alchohol just walk around and enjoy it. It truly is stunning and amazing how extensive the old town is.

Dusmojies, ciet, bet tu neesi izpratusi vienu lietu-ja tev kaut ko dara, tev ir visas tiesības darīt to pašu pretim. Nē nu labi, protams, ka juridiski nē, ķip menti jāsauc, HR jāraksta, jāiet jārunā. Tikai īstenībā, pēc fakta nekas ne sūda nemainās, personu nesauc pie atbildības, kam tur asāka mēle, kam tur smirdīgāka peža, bet viss jau ķip ok.

Labi, ne vislabākais salīdzinājums, bet es noprotu, ka tu, pretēji urlāniem un gopņikiem, neizjūti baudu no šādiem procesiem. Tu negribi cīnīties. Tu nenosūtīji sūdzību, lai gan to uzrakstīji (šis gan ir nē-nē solis).   Pieņemu, ka tev, ir vairāk agreeable, jeb saticīgs temperaments un konflikti tev nepatīk kā tādi.

Take a train trip to Jūrmala (beach town turned ghost town in this season - it's just 30 mins with train - take a walk along the beach, then hop into some bar/cafeteria to warm up and take train back to Riga).

418,1h52yeb,apromurok,"Hi! I'm glad you made this decision!  If I understood well, you stay for three weeks, then I would consider visiting Vilnius or Tallinn or even both. They are a bit more than 4 hours by bus, so maybe one day would be too short, but if you find a cheap accommodation, two days might be enough for some impressions. And ta-da, your Rīga-trip just like that became a whole Baltic-exploration. But if you don't want to travel this much, then you can still visit places in the countryside of Latvia, as others mentioned. If you like hiking and being in nature, don't miss Ķemeri and Piejūra nature parks (both are by the sea), Jūrmala, Sigulda, Cēsis, Valmiera, etc... Rīga, and all the Baltics are very safe, you don't really need to worry about that. In general it's indeed a bit hard to make friends with Latvians, they don't usually start conversations with strangers, but in your case, it also means no (or less) pushy men in bars, which is actually nice. One of my favourite places is Möku bar, you might have even conversations there, but I've only met nice people there, really. They also have events e.g. bingo, karaoke, open mic. There's also a nice jazz club called M/Darbnīca and another great bar, Kaņepes Kultūras Centrs. Visit the central market of course, try smoked salmon, pirogi and anything you like. There's another nice market called Āgenskalns, in the basement you'll find a second-hand store too. If you like museums, check Zuzeum or National Museum of Art. If you like (classical) music, try to find a choir concert, Latvia has an amazing choir culture, and they are really good at it. The National Library also worths a visit, it's free, you can look around, go up to the viewing point, and they usually have some small exhibitions. Go to an ice hockey match if you're interested! A sauna might be also a good choice in this cold. Have fun and enjoy your time!

Something tells me this is just a way to get rid of even more shop employees; which is why today most cashier-manned checkouts are empty. The self-checkouts started it, and they're at least somewhat useful, if there's a long queue at the regular checkouts. Though, there's usually a damn queue at the self-checkout too, esp. at peak hours.

I can say the following.  * Very low prices for everything, except for beauty products. * We pay for rent 250 euros and the centre for 20 minutes by bus. For two people it costs 50 euros to buy a week's worth of food  Riga has a very sea climate, few sunny days, and I take vitamin **D** regularly.  I myself ran away from the threat from russia and I am afraid that something might happen here, but this is the only place where I can live normally so far.  Jobs are pretty scarce. Salaries are low. I'm self-employed, so I don't have a problem with that. It is worth considering that half of the population of Riga speaks Russian, and the older generation does not know English.  Latvian is a very old and difficult language.  I did two years at uni and left. The quality of education is high. I was in an English-speaking group with all sorts of asian people.  I don't like the service industry. There are always different Indians or Arabs there who don't even know English properly, ""hand"" language helps.

609,1gwo0mk,AWonderlustKing,I doubt anything will be open on the 24th other than bars that cater exclusively to tourists (if even that) since Latvians celebrate Christmas on the evening of the 24th rather than the 25th.  On the 25th the Old Town should be a bit more open than on the 24th. I would recommend personally 3 Pavāri - a Michelin guide restaurant in the old town owned and run by Latvia's most well-known celebrity chef. They are usually open on the 25th but I strongly advise making a reservation instead of just showing up.,6,1732239347.0,2024-11-22 01:35:47

For drinks (and some high-end snacks), I suggest **Barents Cocktail &amp; Seafood Bar** (https://www.barents.lv/). While they also have a dedicated restaurant, in my opinion, the bar is better if you're looking to try something new. Just be sure to book the right place, as the bar and restaurant are located close to each other.  These are the first spots that came to mind.

669,1gw8zin,Dylan77Drums,"Hello, I hope this comment helps you. I am an American living in Latvia. I am from Georgia, and I've been in riga for just over a year. I came here after graduating high school, and I'm a uni student here now. In my experience. Knowing latvian is not needed but makes things muuuuch easier. You can also learn Russian and be just as fine. But it might be frowned upon by some people. Knowing only English (like me) is fine as long as you're not talking to someone over 40. It is very difficult to do anything  that doesn't involve young people. Example: going to the doctor, the dentist, any government thing.... some places will have people who speak English, but if you have a friend here that can translate...keep them close lol. Jobs are a different subject. It's very very difficult to get a job here if you only speak English. It's possible, but difficult. It's definitely a better idea to have a job prior to coming that you can do remotely. DO NOT MOVE HERE WITHOUT A JOB! I'm saying this because I just recently got one after trying to find work for a year.....a year! But that's me, not you. The pay wage is very low in latvia compared to the US, so coming here with a remote job from the US will make you live like a king! As of now, the minimum wage is around 3 or 4 euros. The cost of living is low, but again, so is the pay. Just do a lot of planning and research. And if you have any specific questions, just ask me. Quick side note, the US embassy is latvia is a good place to look at for any opportunities.",8,1732188125.0,2024-11-21 11:22:05

It will not help you much to find job, etc.  We focus more and more on prioritizing Latvian language, new laws, initiatives, etc. Also - just check historical reddit posts, smth like ""I am tourist, I know English and Russian, which to use in LV/Riga/etc?

The problem is that some ppl cannot distinct between language and russians supporting putin.   Language wise there is almost no reason to learn Latvian (however I freely speak Latvian and Latgalian for instance).   That can make you sad, you can downvote me, but this is just simple truth.  P.S. It is better to focus making your culture represented in good way to motivate someone to learn more about it, rather than trying to force people, especially in case where they can just simple go to other country where they are not forced to learn local language, but its more like an option to understand better culture and ppl you are living together now.",-2,1732212275.0,2024-11-21 18:04:35

Taxi drivers all speak Russian. Most people there speak English or Russian in addition to Latvian.   If you have a suit or something you can apply for front seat work at nicer hotels, but they probably want people speak many languages.

780,1goeq8s,Spiritual-Jello-9970,"Too early to say, since most places will announce their plans closer to the NY. I would say that all the places can be divided in 4 categories:  1) All-inclusive parties. Those will start from 200 EUR, have dinner, some kind of entertainment, alcohol included (or, at least, bring your own drinks policy). Here's a list - https://www.lattravel.lv/1627.html. The downside is that they are expensive, you might not find any friends there since people will come in their own companies, and they might not be in English. If you are staying in a big hotel, chances are they will have something like this, so try contacting them. The positive is that you pay at once and are busy until the morning.  2) Most restaurants will probably work by reservations in order to avoid wasting resources on passers-by who just want to warm up with a tea or something. Those are usually high - end places, might ask for a deposit during reservation and might have some kind of compliment or celebration, but not as complex as the option Nr. 1. They will probably close soon after 12 and they are a good option if you just want a festive dinner without anyone bothering you, but nothing like a party.  3) Bars and nightclubs will probably be open for anyone until the morning, but thats a hit or miss. You might find a cool place, make local and foreign friends and dance to cool music. At the same time you might end up in 30 minute line for a coctail, step in someones puke or get in fight. Then again, they will either be free of charge or cost a symbolic price to enter, so you can always just move along to the next place.   4) Some places can be closed, so if you have something in mind, you should check whether or not this place will be open in advance.

Every day, I'd head to Origo during my break and then pass through it to get to another university in the evening. Sure, there were always a few sketchy people around, but they mostly kept to themselves, and any real trouble was super rare and usually over quickly. I never saw as much trash back then as I see in the weekly reports on social media now.  I think it’s because areas where these folks used to hang out have become more “civilized” over time—places like Centraltirgus, the areas around the Central Station, and even parts of Maskavas. As these places improved, it pushed the bums and junkies over to Origo.  The next step is to actually increase police patrols here. I don’t know where these people will go, and honestly, I don’t care. But yeah, it’s time for action because it’s definitely worse than it was 5–8 years ago.",2,1730982147.0,2024-11-07 12:22:27
807,1gln409,ThrowMeAwayFuuuck,"Fully agree. The turning point wasn't those areas becoming civilized. These people used to hang out behind the central station, around the bus stop of the central market. Also around the areas where you would exit the tunnels from the central station near the Satiksmes ministrija building. They moved to the front when a large chunk of that area became a construction site due to the rail baltica project. I know someone who works there and goes to work there daily and they pointed it out immediately when the construction started. How those people's favorite hangout spots are unreachable now, so they moved to more visible areas.    And when the first chunk of the sketchy residents started hanging out in the front, that's when more children appeared as well.    ""Back in my youth"" the area in front of Origo was the hangout place for the first wave of the emo kids simply because people often went there to hangout when they would take a train to the capital. Like if you're one of those kids, you probably don't have many friends in your hometown, so you would take a train to the capital to hang out with other rebellious types. I am not that ingrained into the current youth culture now, since I am not their age. But I do know that there has definitely been the emo resurgence, with that subculture becoming popular again. And if the rebellious types choose the area to be their hangout spot again and now there are more of the sketchy types, it can become an environment of a bad influence for these vulnerable kids.",4,1731044865.0,2024-11-08 05:47:45

816,1gln409,TheoKeys,"My father’s entire family was Latvian. They came to the US in the late 1800s through the 1920s and as far as I know, I was the first one to come back. The irony is that I took 4 years of Russian in high school anticipating a visit- and we see how that turned out.  First visited in 2023 for 4 days, liked it so much we rented an apartment in old town for a month (June) this year. Already have a place next June, more in the Centrs area.  I love the architecture- the contrast between the Art Nouveau and the Soviet era. The cultural stuff- we went to the Opera House for a performance of the Verdi Requiem and it was fantastic. Love M/Darbnica- was really impressed with the jazz scene there. The museums (particularly the arr museum) are amazing. The food scene was much more varied than I expected.  The people reminded me of my father’s family.  Not very gregarious until you got to know them, but very bright with a dry, smart-ass sense of humor.i had great interactions with everyone we met.  As far as traveling to the US, I would certainly never discourage anyone from coming over. If you’re thinking rural, I would strongly recommend West Texas and the Big Bend area. It’s almost surreal, totally unlike any place like it anywhere in the world and very desolate. Colorado is fantastic as well. As far as riding a horse – it’s definitely overrated, but worth doing at least once..  As far as cities go,  I’d definitely recommend New York. Ignore all the scary stories, it’s way, way safer than it was back in the 70s. You could spend a month there and not get bored. You might also look at Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington DC. And New Orleans – my favorite city in the United States (to visit).  Anyway, didn’t mean to ramble, but I think my interest in Latvia is largely due to my family connection.

972,1gdxsi0,psihius,"The overall cleanliness is due to the laws we have.  Owners of buildings are responsible for daily upkeep of their territory by law. In city centre they are required to have an urn for trash and timely emptying it so it does not overflow. They either have to employ someone who's job it is to keep things clean or employ a company that provides the service. The fines are pretty steep and you will find out almost immediately that it is far cheaper to keep things clean.  This rule about trash cans being available everywhere and being a certain density is what makes disposing of trash trivial. Every store has at least one, usually a few. Every public transport stop has one. Every building in the city centre has one. Out in the less densely built areas, there are rules around there being some kind of way to dispose of trash.  Abandoned stuff might take a while to deal (going through all the legal stuff), but in the end if you ignore it, the municipality will do the cleanup and send you a bill. Eventually, if owners ignore those things, courts get involved and things get sold off.  Latvia historically had a thing for keeping our streets clean and we have laws that reinforce them, so any kind of property ownership includes either you directly being responsible for organising the upkeep (yourself, having a contract with a service or employing people directly) or your management company doing that in the case of apartments.",6,1730116236.0,2024-10-28 11:50:36

Of course, the city center and Old Town are kept quite tidy, but outside the center, there’s a lot of garbage, open or overflowing trash bins with trash spilled onto the streets, and empty, broken liquor bottles thrown everywhere by drunks. There are also damaged bus stops and apartment windows—not to mention the thousands of buildings whose facades look like they could fall apart at any moment.

Some few years ago the building was given to german lutherans, for them to carry out renovations etc. (See wiki latvian article, the information is more or less current) So, setup of althar in this case is ""as best as they could"", imo.",3,1729408974.0,2024-10-20 07:22:54

Regarding design - prevatican postvatican face to congregation back to congregation - i do not think anyone of churchgoers gives it any importance here.

I suspect most church goers don’t pay particular attention, but once you know what you’re looking for and the religious significance, you notice.   If you wanted to observe the differences in how the alter is used in pre vs post Vatican II, you can go to (or find video of) a Traditional Latin Mass vs a Novous Ordo Mass.  As for the interior, it’s a beautiful structure but the decor is very plain which makes the alter the sole point of interest.  The why behind how a religious space is used is more interesting to me than the aesthetics.  Theres not much to look it, but that’s a lot of the point of the Reformation.   So from that perspective, I appreciate what the space is communicating.  I went up to the tower at sunset and that was fabulous.  Cold, but great views.",2,1729448648.0,2024-10-20 18:24:08

1265,1g23vw1,Onetwodash,"Ok, that's helpful. If we look up Mazā Jaunavu in google streetview, it doesn't have this type of pavement but a fairly modern material instead (likely from 90s), and that's 2014 photo.  There have been A LOT of renovations in that general area repeatedly removing and replacing the cobblestones, sometimes replacing historic ones with modern stuff, then removing them to more 'historically accurate' look. I didn't  manage to find documentation for that street at the moment though and probably doesn't matter. That street also has extremely narrow and quite uneven sidewalks, so the arcs look a bit weird.  It's just meant to be a fan-shaped pattern. Super popular all across Europe for low traffic areas (as it's awful for narrow wheels) - just google sampietrini or european fan pattern. (Sampietrini actually refers to the type of bricks used in Rome, not the pattern and they're sometimes laid out in regular brick pattern instead - but you'll find plenty of sampietrinis in fan pattern as well, so that's a decent keyword to use.)   It kinda looks historical and supposedly is easy for bricklayer to adjust to uneven brick sizes, uneven surfaces and sudden ends/turns/corners and such while still maintaining some general semblance of the pattern, supposedly it also allows bricklayer to work faster, from inside of the arc out. Chopping granite stones in half is labor intensive and generates unhealthy particles, so pattern that allows to adjust to irregularities is good.  It's mostly used for decorative purposes as architect in charge of renovation in question decided it's a good idea, perhaps similar pattern was used there historically, perhaps it wasn't. And just look at Barona iela to see what happens when architect goes wild with ideas about bricks.. could be worse.   The pattern isn't great to drive across, but it's considered fine-ish for low pdestrian traffic.  The specific bricks used in the photo do in fact have surfaces that are less slippery when wet, but it's not going to help much when it's frozen over and anti-slipperiness isn't related to the pattern. Romes sampietrini are notoriously slippery even when in this pattern and Rome doesn't exactly see  half a year of ice and darkness.",2,1728904018.0,2024-10-14 11:06:58

I am 100% certain that is the same story here. Same reason as everyone said - grip (but for carriages). You usually find them in the arched passages that lead to courtyards.   Edit: there used to be way more of them. Since the streets have changed severely, it is less often that you can witness them. But in some places (mostly old towns) you can still find them around.

We're just not loud and extroverted in public, making friends with every person we come across. A well-traveled friend of mine considers his northern friends to be in general more reserved and calm and reliable friends for life, while southern friends can be very fun and adventurous, but not always reliable and floating in and out of his life.

I almost use no cash in Latvia, so I think you can just don’t think about this. The only thing is tips.  3. You can buy in Mobilly tickets for Riga Public Transport (Busses, trams and trolleys) and for trains too. If you buys tickets for the train for specific route it will be valid only for the specific train and specific route. For the busses there is the same system.  About Riga transport: the most popular option is to buy ticket for 90 minutes. Obviously this ticket is gonna work 90 minutes, and during this time you can activate this ticket (for another buses) as many times as you want. You can even activate this ticket on 89th minute and drive until the end of the route.  4. Go visit the Latvian National Library for the good view from the top of the building. It’s free, but I would suggest to call them and ask is the top floor is open.  Go visit Agenskalns and agenskalns market 5. Don’t limit yourself only on Riga’s Old Town. It’s more of a tourist trap now. Take a walk around the quiet center and other cities in Latvia. You have 5 days.

You can search for the websites lieliska davana and davanu serviss for activities around Riga. You can buy a gift card there or go to the business’ website to see if they have availability. Other than that, keep exploring Google maps for interesting things especially around old town.   Check out Lido. And there’s also a panorama view of the city on the Latvijas Zinātņu akadēmija. Not sure if it’s available then, but you can search for it. Tickets must be paid in cash and as of two years ago they were 5 euro I think.   We have a botanical garden as well. If the greenhouses are running then, it could be nice. We also have huge malls, so that’s another thing to check out. Ooh and definitely help yourself to the hot drink vending machines that are around.   Plenty to do and see.

Your line about ""meeting girls"", however, is disrespectful and shows what you're really after, despite saying you're not. Latvian women are too smart for you. Someone who openly admits he wants to ""meet women because they're beautiful"", is usually giving off the creep vibe and we can smell that from a mile away. Don't. Do. It. Plus, you're here for 2 days. Latvians aren't like you, we don't just talk to strangers or become friends immediately. Shows how little you understand of the mindset. Latvians don't throw around their friendship or company, and if you try to approach anyone, they will probably see you as a creep.

1496,1fjb65d,o_eRviNNhaS,"Hi u/marijaenchantix  Thank you for your kind post, recommendations and guidance. Very useful and very welcoming.  Now, a bit more seriously:  I've been googling Riga and what to do for a while, was looking more for personal experiences, rather than a guide for masses. We can all do that, but if you're after more unique experiences and hidden gems that not always are mentioned on mainstream city guides, you come here, and ask.  Like I did in the last 31 countries I visited. And up to date, still hold contact with many of those I met on my way, socializing as described above.  You were definitely rude, judgmental, and unpleasant by the way you addressed to me.  I'm not really after anything more than what I wrote, so please stop creating monsters in your attic, they don't exist. I'm a very outgoing person, I socialize very easily everywhere in the world. Talking and approaching people, in this planet was never hard or unpleasant to me. I'm a peoples person, like to talk and get to know the language, habits, food culture and so on. Therefore, unless the Latvians you describe are really from another planet, I don't see any difficulty or barrier preventing this from happening. And the ones I work with, and worked in the past, are way different from the picture you describe. You know, it's quite a lot of Latvians living here in Norway...  **I'm sorry if you had negative experiences in the past and come here projecting what happened to you before.**  As I said, I'm only after a good time, exploring the city, the food and a bit of the nightlife. If I am able to meet people and have a good chat, even better, if not, life goes on.  You give a very negative and chauvinist perspective of Latvia and its population by generalizing a snobbish way of welcoming and treating tourists.

I understand you are from a warm country with extroverted locals, but you are not everyone, and it is very rare that someone from here would immediately jump to the opportunity to be your friend or have a one night stand with you. We just don't do that. I don't know how familiar you are with more northern cultures, but clearly you need to familiarise yourself with it and the way to talk to people. There is nothing snobbish about the fact you clearly lack the understanding of how people communicate in other countries. Not everyone will welcome you with open arms like your country does. In fact, we don't like to be approached by strangers, we don't like loud or overly chatty people. Which is what you seem to be. I gave you a fair warning that you may need to tone it down.

On Lienes Street you'll find Nurme Brewery, which has a cool vibe. A bit further there is a decent burger place (OAK'a Burger) and next to it another place - Karbonades. Worth checking the menu online, maybe it's up your alley. But, foods deffo worth it.  Nurme Brewery is nearby Tallinas Kvartāls somebody mentioned in another comment.  You can stop for a coffee at Ziedondarzs there is a cafe there (Paviljons Ziedondarzs), nice views, nice chill atmosphere.   Maybe there is something going on in Andrejsala during your visit. There are a few restaurants - Koya, Mute.Riga. Check the menu, if it suits your budget.   Near Kronvalda Park there are a few places for food - particularly, around the corner of Dzirnavu iela &amp; Antonijas iela. Good menu, good quality food. However, this is more upper class.   It's deffo worth to try LIDO for lunch after a night of partying. ""Traditional Latvian comfort food"" (baked potato, various kinds of meats, fish, pancakes with mushroom filling, etc.)   I don't know much about art and culture - modern art exhibitions you'll find in galleries in old Riga are quite amateurish level. Might be interesting to see for comparison, if you're involved in the field, but will leave you unsatisfied, if you're just a casual enthusiast.  Art space Kim? (on Sporta street, nearby Andrejsala &amp; Kronvalda Park) sometimes has some good stuff going on, usually, which provokes thought. Check online in advance - https://kim.lv/en/[https://kim.lv/en/](https://kim.lv/en/)  Museum of Occupation might offer something different from things you'd see elsewhere. With the things going on in Ukraine, these guys have been experiencing occasional hate crime against them.  If you're willing to travel, I would recommend a day trip outside Riga - first, Līgatnes Bunkurs (a soviet nuclear shelter) and afterwards a bus ride to Cēsis before heading back to Riga.

1643,1f9smy9,Onetwodash,"With time this short, Cesis (or Sigulda!) would take priority over Rundale.  Rundale is best around when roses are in full bloom. It's notable for being a French-style palace this far in the north, that's well renovated and has beautiful garden built and maintained around it.  If you've seen Versailles, you already have a photobook of French style palaces though so... yeah. Would still be worth it in May and it's really cool for when they have some events (like concerts, theaters, galas), but you're visiting in September.  Cesis/Sigulda are prettiest when leaves start changing colors in autumn - what may or may not be around the time for your trip, but there's at least a chance. They're both in very scenic locations overlooking Gauja valley, both have centuries old castle ruins (Sigulda has two and has plenty of scenic spots cleared of the tree coverage for picture taking across the valley), interesting history to go with it and such. Cesis is very quaint old town itself, Sigulda however is not.  Do note that while Latvia in general is super flat, Cesis and especially Sigulda are the exceptions, there's a lot of elevation change, stairs and such - something to keep in mind if you have mobility issues.  If you're into photography, Sigulda would be the standard suggestion - assuming the weather is good and trees are starting to color golden/red.  If weather is rubbish  or you specifically want the old quaint town vibes - Cesis.  Sigulda/Cesis are also served by a comfy train line.  Train stops in the respective town centers for both, very walkable distance from everywhere you wanted to get. Sigulda has in-city buses if you don't want to walk all the way to Turaida castle and back, although a cooler option is to use the cable car across the river.",1,1725602571.0,2024-09-06 06:02:51

That was what I was thinking about regarding Rundale, might have been better in late spring/early summer, but this is going to basically be last week of September.

Obviously not every immigrant or traveler would be bad person, but please understand why local people can have their opinions. Vast majority of those illegal immigrants didn't came here to do honest work, instead they built their ghettos, they made peaceful cities dangerous, they are aggressive towards woman and other local beliefs and religions. It didn't affect Latvia as severely since we don't have such rich benefits here, but we do see what is happening in other European countries. So yes, we will stand up for our own values, land and also woman. To call that ""racism"" would be incorrect. You think that other cultures don't protect their woman and values? People in US also have their own to protect, we over several seas have ours. Fair enough? Everyone have their boarders and limits as to how far they can be welcoming. Here we also have ongoing war in neighboring country. They call us ""russophobes"", ""fascists"" and even ""dogs"" for not wanting to give up our own language, history and even country. Like - where does this stop and doesn't become some ""...phobe"" or ""racist"" thing? EU cities are trashed, woman r\*ped, in other countries bombs are falling. Meanwhile someone in shop starred at someone bit too long and didn't say anything much? I'm sure there are all sorts of problems in US.  Obviously there are more or less actually racist people as everywhere, but lots of it is just each persons perception and cultural thing. For example in US there are lots of fake smiles and talking, but I see that as rude and even sort of aggressive. While if someone from US comes here they might think that Latvians are rude (or even racist?) because they don't have fake smiles each time someone walks in their shop, cashiers don't ask ""how are you"" and don't chit chat about life. Also there can be difference between Latvians and those Russians who live here. Russians tend to be more bold and racistic, especially older generations.

(Mols especially)  The Latvian Academy of Sciences is a very tall building and you can take an elevator to the top and see the whole city. Bring cash for buying the tickets.   Of course there are other historical things like the old KGB building, the Freedom Monument, the war museum, five of the nine Zeppelin hangars remaining in the world, etc. I highly recommend watching videos online of historical Riga. So much history in there and you can see old Riga and how similar it is today.  As for food, here is my advice. For reference, my palate is American. There is some amazing food here and locals might recommend things like pankukas and biezpiens. Biezpiens is essentially a dryer cottage cheese. I can do cottage cheese, but I can’t do biezpiens. Pankukas often contain biezpiens.  Lidot is a great place to for experiencing Latvian culture. There are several locations around Riga with some bigger than others. Their meats are amazing and everything else as well.  Additionally, pop into Rimi for some pastries and a glimpse of our products. They have a lot of souvenirs—especially the Rimi in Old Town. We also have hot drink machines around the city.   Try to avoid chains like McDonalds. You’ve probably had them before and they’re exactly the same. If you want something sorta similar but much better, have some Kebabs at one of the many Kebab restaurants.   Visit malls around Riga, especially if you’re feeling homesick. Malls are quite young places and so they tend to have more English things. Origo is lovely especially for train-watching. The second floor of the newer section will bring you outside to the platforms. Or you can go through the older part where the train station terminal is. When at Origo, keep to yourself and watch your belongings. Don’t let yourself get distracted by anyone either.   There’s a ton of stuff to do here like ElectroKarting, Ice skating, and spa stuff. Just search Lieliska Davana for listings of various activities. No need to buy a gift card, just navigate to their website. You can also go to Google Maps and explore the various places.  Trams are fun and there is also a hop on hop of sightseeing bus. It’s bright red and has two levels. You can find many parks here as well and even boat tours.  Sigulda (a nearby city) is outside of Riga but it has a ton of history. Jurmala is another city outside of Riga and that’s where you’ll find the beach.

2054,1ezmvo5,3lzaa,"For history occupation museum. For art- National museum of art. If you want to try local food, then go to Lido. But there are a lot of amazing places to eat in city center. I would recommend not to eat in Old town. Walk a lot in the streets of Riga and enjoy the Art Nouveau architecture, specially Alberta street. There is also Art Nouveau museum in Riga. I wouldn’t recommend taking pastries from rimi or other big chain stores, it’s much better to eat dough products in designated cafes, of which there are many in Riga.   If you want to go out of the capital city, then I suggest to go to Sigulda, Cēsis, Kuldīga, Ķemeru purvs at sunset/sunrise. You can go there by renting a car from Bolt or by bus or some of the places by train. But also feel free to use Rigas Satiksme in city center.",2,1724710993.0,2024-08-26 22:23:13

But do note, that some exhibits can be quite shocking to the faint of heart (two headed dogs, the bubonic plague city view, African woodoo dolls, organs in a jar, glands operation scene, etc..), but since 3rd grade me survived it, I bet you can too 🤭  https://www.mvm.lv/en",2,1724789594.0,2024-08-27 20:13:14

During the 90s it had a bad reputation for thiefs (just like a lot of other parts of Rīga), but in the last 20 years it has become much, much nicer.  Pros: - The bike trail from Jugla to VEF. If you work somewhere in between, it is amazing to be able to use a bike without any worries. - The 1st tram, as mentioned. You can get to the center without any problems within 25mins. - Akropole Alfa is a 20min walk away. If you don't need the big shops, you have small Rimi and Maxima within 5min walking. A bigger rimi in Jugla Center within 10mins. - Since I can roughly imagine where you are living (I've lived around there for around 30 years now), that is a NICE area, full of families and old people. - Every bus that goes out of town that way stops at the Jugla bus stop. So if you want to go somewhere in Vidzeme, it's very simple. - There's a nice kebab place that opened a year ago not far from you :D  Cons: - The woods are dirty and at the moment being thinned out, so they are full of machines. Unfortunately, you mighy see some drunks there and around it that are relicts of the old era. Just need to wait them out, because sooner or later they will die out, but meanwhile at least in my experience they have always kept to themselves... *hoping*  - Traffic on Brīvība street at certain times, but if you don't drive a car, it will not impact you at all.

2161,1evsaip,SunDyu,"I'm local. The issue with ADHD meds in Latvia is that officially ADHD is not recognized as a condition adults can be diagnosed with. It needs to be done since childhood.   In my case, overall I spent 7 years visiting various psychiatrists and doctors, stating clear evidence and suspicion towards ADHD - most of them blamed anxiety and depression, which was a symptom. When I was fed up with it, I aggressively pressed my psychiatrist who admitted there is not one person in the whole clinic (Veldre) who can test me for this.  Went to a private specialist who diagnosed me within 15 minutes and explained the horror of our system. i.e. an adult cannot be diagnosed with ADHD in Latvia through official, state-funded channels. There is no mechanism for this. Yes, it is as insane as it sounds. I was very close to going to Bez Tabu about this bullshit.",1,1724148084.0,2024-08-20 10:01:24

We generally don't do this whole "" well you had a meth addiction so keep taking it just less"". Generally, in my experience, doctors more subscribe to the "" just quit"" mindset.   You are a foreigner, so getting a controlled substance would likely be very difficult for you, if you can even find a doctor who speaks English and would be willing to give you this. They have no way to know if you aren't just asking for drugs and will disappear or something.   No, a GP is not allowed to prescribe such controlled substances and most doctors don't want to get involved with it as it requires regular control of you, and since you are a foreigner and who knows what you are doing here, they can't know that you will show up. Especially since oyu have proven that you can't even arrange these things on time for yourself.   Same goes for your ADHD meds. I think only a narcologist or psychiatrist can give you ADHD meds, but they will probably have to diagnose you again, your past paperwork doesn't apply here as each country has different regulations. If you take meds, why are you blaming your ADHD for procrastinating?      Regarding staying here, you know that you can't stay for more than 90 days without leaving, right?

Snatch has only a couple of vegan options, but a few more vegetarian ones..  Shoyu does a good vege ramen, and other bits  Space falafel probably has the widest variety of options though.  Riga in general is pretty good for vegetarian/vegan, much better than it was 10 / 15 years ago when I first came.",1,1723834730.0,2024-08-16 18:58:50

2216,1es6vxl,Krishjanis,"Many of these have already been mentioned, but my 2 cents: - Max Cekot: I think the most high-end option in Riga. You can go with the food menu only, I think it’s below 200€ per person, and get a couple drinks separately instead of the wine/juice menu - Snatch: Italian food with a twist, but it’s tasty. The steak is great, and so is the cheesecake, which I’d say is one of the most authentic you can find in Riga - Italissimo: nice Italian place, no crazy innovations, just good food and service. If you have kids there’s a playground on the basement floor  - Riviera: same owners as italissimo, Mediterranean cuisine, really nice, but still good price/performance in my eyes.

2373,1emjcqd,TharixGaming,"october is kind of a shit time to come here in terms of weather since you don't get the nice warm flowery summer or the pretty snowy winter with all the decorations and christmas markets - but you're from scotland you'll be used to it  for bars, my top recommendation is folkklubs ala pagrabs - everyone recommends it, but trust me it's not overhyped. they have great latvian food (you HAVE to try latvian garlic bread aka ķiploku grauzdiņi) and a solid selection of drinks - not just beers, but also ciders and cocktails (which i appreciate, being a beer hater).   another decent place to get some drinks and food is ezītis miglā - which i guess is kind of the latvian version of wetherspoons? (though i like the vibe of ezītis way better) they have fairly cheap drinks and decent food, mainly the kind of food that's extra good when you're drunk - burgers, fried stuff, etc.  another place to check out is tallinas kvartāls - it's a bit hard to find since it's a courtyard that you have to go down an alley to get into, but there's a sign pointing to it. it's got a few different bars and street food-type restaurants, they have events there fairly often as well, definitely recommend checking it out.  for things to see, if y'all have a day to spare i recommend a day trip out to the town of sigulda - it's an hour away by train, and the trains go about every 1-2 hours from riga central station and cost 2.50 in each direction.   in riga, definitely go around the old town, if y'all want to learn more about our history i recommend the occupation museum, as well as the corner house (the old latvian HQ of the kgb, which has been converted into a museum)",3,1723294810.0,2024-08-10 13:00:10

Either way, bacterial contaminantion in water in Riga are are not an issue outside of 'nearby local works' days when there is a local warning.  The only flavor concerns are high-ish iron content, especially from older pipes (that's what causes yellow staining in non-maintained bathrooms) and general water hardness (again, not a health issue, but tea and coffee extracts better in softer water - so you may want to filter or use bottled water if you want to appreciate every smallest nuance in your hot drink).

The rent and bills are 600-800€ before you start to think that we got all that spare money left lying around lol.  I did a bad thingy, I got around the system to register an account and buy games through a cheaper country. I rarely want to play new games but when I do, I use that account to buy them. I wouldn't have to do that if the prices were tried to the country's average salary instead of location. Like, imagine South America having the same game prices as North America, that's location pricing for you.

For coffee, try local roasters like Kalve or Rocket Bean, they're good. There are nice bakeries like Mīkla, Kūre, Muffins &amp; More, Bul's Bakery. Stay away from Caffeine, unless you want a sugary milk drink with a few drops of coffee in it.  If you want an interesting vibe, there's Art Cafe Sienna.",2,1722578235.0,2024-08-02 05:57:15

You can check humanalatvia.lv to see what prices you can expect, they have a rolling schedule. At full price the items can be quite pricey (up to 20-25 euros per piece) but the price is gradually lowered until everything is 50 cents. In my experience, the sweet spot is the stretch between -50% and 4 euros an item.",1,1722590872.0,2024-08-02 09:27:52
2618,1ehbnq9,VnotTori,"Depends on what you want... My cousin and I went to Humana vintage (it's slightly more expensive compared to other Humana thrifts, but the items are actually going to be vintage. Got a really cool heart necklace for 12€ with a large metal pendant) - pretty cool atmosphere and you can have a sip of coffee right there if only one of you is into shopping (it's completely free for customers and right next to the entrance).   If you want a cheap, yet interesting experience, I would recommend going to Caffeine and ordering "" es nezinu ko es gribu"" -the bartender decides themselves what coffee they want to give you, you only get to decide weather it's hot or cold. I got an M size and paid about 3,30€, got a big cup of delicious cinnamon coffee!   If you want to drink coffee more lavishly, I cannot recommend Costa coffee at Stockmann enough! They have absolutely delicious seasonal drinks and imo overpriced, yet delicious cakes.  If you want a more authentic experience-Lido is your way to go! They are scattered across Rīga and you'll find more Latvian tasting food there! Not sure how the prices are now, but it's a bistro, so probably pretty good compared to other places.   And Hooligan bubble tea for extra points - a pretty good boba joint if you like that, but avoid ordering matcha at all costs (it tastes like fish and I had to throw mine away!)  If I were you, I would check out the DGS thrifts in Riga as well, not sure if those have any vintage but I personally love them. If it has a DGS premium, you might be able to find brand new brand-name clothing pieces.   Check out Otrā elpa too - the clothes are the least interesting part, although you may find some designer items for cheap. They have a lot of books, trinkets and other cool stuff as well as old Latvian magazines.  Not that familiar with bakeries in Rīga, but you might look up ""Mārtiņa beķereja"" as an option... Haven't been there myself but I've seen the sign countless times.  Hope this helps and good luck on your trip!",2,1722587923.0,2024-08-02 08:38:43

2783,1edq02u,Illustrious_Load_728,"Alr.  First of all “you see what you want to see” works both ways, you know.  Second thing - depends on occupation. For example, in my surroundings and field I’m in, 3 out of 10 people left to study, came back after they got master’s and doctorate (Switzerland, Norway, Germany) and stayed. One left.  (Belgium). Everyone else either stayed to study and eventually work here or did Erasmus, but didn’t go to study full time. Living happy life and so do I. Also, “every second family”? Yeah, source is that you made that up?   Third thing - of course no one will stay in small 7k town, lol, what do you expect? As if in other countries everyone born and raised in a small town and/or village where nothing is going on/they can’t find their calling/whatever other reason to move to a bigger city will stay there and not move to a bigger city, while visiting on holidays. Yeah, that’s a Latvia-exclusive, surely.  Fourth thing, did those that went to find happiness actually found it or they still work 3 jobs to pay off the student loans, insanely priced appartments and groceries? You know that qualified specialist’s salaries are exponentially larger or smaller depending on a country they live in? Yeah. Also, “they work and live in poverty”, what are they doing? Mopping the streets? Working as a postman in a village? There are shitty jobs that pay shit, but they are shitty jobs all around the globe, if you can’t do a well paid job, cos you are not qualified to - you won’t be paid well anywhere, lmao, and you will still work and live in poverty.  Fifth thing, “rose tinted glasses” is not my thing. There are A WHOLE LOT OF things that are falling behind a lot of bigger countries, though they are improving gradually, things are not as bad as they were 10 years ago. Latvia is not the worst country in the EU by any margin and it’s doing just fine especially if you consider the fact that it was being staled and regressed by a russki-pussi occupation for what, 50 years? Yeah.",1,1722270218.0,2024-07-29 16:23:38
2784,1edq02u,Clear-Substance-8031,"First off, sure, perceptions matter, but let’s not forget facts and data. Latvia's demographic and economic challenges are pretty well-documented, not just based on personal stories.  Second, about people leaving for studies and jobs - while some do come back, the bigger picture shows a lot more people leaving than returning. Eurostat data even shows Latvia has one of the highest emigration rates in the EU. Many young professionals leave and don’t come back, leading to brain drain and workforce shortages.  Third, rural depopulation isn’t just a Latvia thing, but it hits us harder. Rural areas here are aging fast and losing people, leading to school and business closures. This just makes things worse over time, and compared to other European countries, Latvia faces these issues more intensely.  Fourth, about life abroad - many Latvians move because they find better job opportunities and higher wages, even if living costs and student loans are high. Studies show that emigrants generally end up better off economically compared to staying in Latvia.  Fifth, sure, low-paid jobs exist everywhere, but in Latvia, the issue is worse because of limited opportunities and lower average wages compared to Western Europe. This pushes people to look for better prospects abroad, where even lower-skilled jobs offer better pay and conditions.  Lastly, about the USSR, let’s be real. During the USSR era, Latvia got significant investments, infrastructure, and support. It was a prestigious place to live, with plenty of resources and opportunities. Now, the current ruins and abandoned places are a stark contrast to that time. The issues today aren’t because of the past occupation; they’re because Latvia hasn’t effectively transitioned and used its potential post-independence. We let pride guide us into a crisis, refusing to trade with Russia even though it could be profitable",0,1722276751.0,2024-07-29 18:12:31
2785,1edq02u,Illustrious_Load_728,"I agree on a lot of things you say, I’ll just add something to consider.   USSR: yes, they invested heavily, however they were a heavily sanctioned country, technologically behind Western world for like 30 years at minimum.  Wages: yes, they are higher in Western Europe. As are prices. On everything.  Statistics: yes. However, they don’t paint the exact picture. Latvia isn’t dead, however looking at stats you’d think that it’s only babuškas and a few infants. (Over exaggerated, but you got it, I hope)  People leaving: well, that’s a loop. People started leaving because things were not good in early 2000s. Latvia couldn’t get much better, because they left and didn’t pay any taxes. People left, because Latvia couldn’t get much better, because people left and didn’t pay any taxes. Latvia coul… Yeah. And that affects rural areas and whatnot.    Also, the fucking “vissslikti” mindset. Fuck me. Leaving, crying on reddit, doing nothing, but “vissslikti”.  Otherwise, you are kinda right.",1,1722279071.0,2024-07-29 18:51:11
2786,1edq02u,Clear-Substance-8031,"Hey man, I appreciate that you see some reason in what I’ve said, even though many Latvians might not agree. I understand that we’re all proud of our country and want it to succeed, but there are facts we need to face to move forward.  One key point is that the USSR isn’t and never was the main issue. While many blame the Soviet government for Latvia’s current state, it’s not entirely accurate. The USSR dissolved over 30 years ago. Since then, many other European nations, including our Baltic neighbors and Poland, have adapted and improved. Latvia, however, has struggled to catch up. Claiming that the USSR was technologically 30 years behind is also misleading. The USSR was a major global player, involved in significant technological advancements and the space race.  Regarding statistics, I mentioned that around 1.5 million Latvians are officially counted as living in Latvia. However, this number is inflated since many, including myself, still maintain a residence or have a GP here but live abroad. This overestimation skews the real picture of the population.  As for the migration loop, you’re right—there’s a cycle where people leave because conditions are tough, which in turn hinders improvement due to a reduced tax base. Many Latvians aspire to see their country thrive but often choose to leave for better opportunities elsewhere. In Western Europe, despite higher living costs, the opportunities for higher wages make a significant difference. For example, a factory worker in the UK can earn close to £2,000 a month, which is multiple times the salary in Latvia. With a partner working as well, they can lead a comfortable life, unlike in Latvia where low-skilled jobs don’t offer the same financial stability.  Regarding the “vissslikti” mindset, it’s important to understand the frustration behind it. When people consistently face challenges and see little improvement, it's natural to complain. Many Latvians want to be proud of their country, but the lack of unity and opportunities often drives them to seek a better life elsewhere. Until Latvia can offer better prospects and a unified vision for the future, this trend is likely to continue",1,1722282008.0,2024-07-29 19:40:08
2787,1edq02u,Illustrious_Load_728,"It’s nice to have a conversation :D  Few things again. USSR was and wasn’t technologically behind. Sure, they participated and in the space and nuclear races, but uhh, so did the USA? While having actually comfortable cars that they did… By themselves? And all the other different little things? See, the point I’m getting at is, yeah, USSR wasn’t that far behind, but it’s this little thing about the capitalism - competitiveness, where everyone is trying to get better than their neighbour/friend/name it, by developing something new, better and whatnot. I don’t think that unbiased fella would ever pick, say, RAF over uhhh, dunno, some nice big family wagon with A/C? Or Volga 21 over Caddy DeVille? Or Radiotehnika over Pioneer? Or Siemens over RVR ER-2? Nah. Sure, maybe the rockets were better, but in the end, Latvia had nothing to offer to the freshly opened gigantic capitalist market. That was more the point of me pointing fingers to the big bad Soviet Onion.  So with all of that ALONGSIDE with greedy and bumfuck stupid political and private decisions we do get what we get, yes.  Won’t argue about the migration things, I   see the reasoning, kinda old going thing even in the folklore. “Laimīti meklēt” and such things.   However, I still don’t know where do you find those happy faces, that moved from Riga to say, Colchester or even worse, somewhere in US, found the lowest paying job and are happier than they ever would be if they lived the same way in here. Maybe the stories sound happy, but I highly doubt that a lowest paid worker is living in a 3 bedroom flat with a garage, AC and driving his Bmw 530d to the factory, somehow. More like 15 m2 room with a shared shower. Which is most likely the same. Depends on the field people are in, though, I’m more educated on my field and my own personal experiences on working abroad in different conditions.   Regarding the visslikti again. I don’t really see the reasoning behind the frustration though, because It’s funny to see the demographic of “vissslikti” crowd. It’s MOSTLY either the ones that left somewhere in the early 2000s and are still shitting their home just to validate their decisions; or the ones that actually don’t do shit (whether it’s about their own life or about their service to the country) and are just yapping. Oh, and the “A VOT V SAVECKAM SAJUZE VOT PUTEN RASIJA MALADCI” crowd, but, well, fuck em. Although, there are some topics that it’s collectively okay to cry about and I won’t say a single thing about that. Roads, for example, fucking hell. Also, yeah. All the Baltic brothers did it better, which is a good example to look at and get better. Which is happening. Not as fast as everyone in Delfi comments would like it to happen, but it is.  Bottom line of my whole rant is this: 1) there are happy people in Latvia 2) not everything is complete and absolute shit 3) just saying visslikti doesn’t help 4) leaving doesn’t help 5) if we want the country/city/village/your own house to be better we must do it ourselves, no one’s gonna magically appear and make Latvia or whatnot suddenly great  Have a nice one ✌️",1,1722290745.0,2024-07-29 22:05:45
2788,1edq02u,dreamrpg,"Lets not forget that prior to occupation Latvia did very well. And economic, demographic challenges are largely caused by ussr distorting production, ethnic composition and values.   For instance many ""investments"" were of wrong type and in wrong places. Ineffective factories in places that do not have capacity to operate without force feeding workers.   Those wrong places made a need for roads, beidges nobody needed without those useless factories.   And demographics, guess what happened when in 90s you could be punched into face just because you speak language? That efectively cut potential partnership by third at least.   And what happened in 90s? Every post ussr country was fucked so bad that nobody had spare for kids.   And today of course it is not ussr fault anymore, but it played a role in 90s, and huge one.

In all those places, and in many other shops in Riga that sell wine, you can find a small selection, mostly in the 7-15 € range, and almost exclusively bottled by large companies.  Depending on what sort of wine you were drinking in Georgia, this may, or may not, satisfy you.   However, if you want a much wider selection of Georgian wine, including hundreds of bottles from smaller, higher quality, wine-makers that you will definitely _not_ find in supermarkets, ( or, as far as I know, anywhere else in Riga … though I would love to be proved wrong ! ) … then the best place _by far_ that I have found is in the wine shop in the Alaverdi restaurant at Grēcinieku iela 8 in the old town.   This slightly confusing establishment consists of two restaurants ( one Georgian, one Mediterranean ) and the Georgian wine shop / cellar, which is pretty much hidden away in the basement  ;-) )  They have literally hundreds of references, which you can buy in the shop or try in the very good Georgian restaurant there.  The quality of the wine there is far beyond anything you will find in the supermarkets … but, be warned, so are the prices.

You had said that he or she “will never find it exported” which isn’t really true … as I said elsewhere, you won’t find much of a range in the supermarkets, but that doesn’t mean that what you call “local” wine isn’t ever exported, just that it isn’t imported by the big distribution companies that feed the supermarkets and liquor chains …   … but, as I said, that isn’t “never” … unless you “never” look further than supermarkets !  But sure, as I said myself in my other post, things, as always with wine, can get pricy if you are looking for the good stuff … but I have often found excellent Georgian wine for very reasonable prices in a number of wine shops in Riga … and I also actually enjoy some of the supermarket stuff ( especially dry whites ) … but that is a question of taste …   Cheers !  ps thanks for the thanks re: alaverdi ;-)",2,1722222887.0,2024-07-29 03:14:47

They also have vit c/magnesium/zinc combination dissolvable tablets like Emergen-C in the US.

Also keep in mind that the area become in demand before they become clean - nobody wants to buy peak value properties. And the new local residents are fighting to clean the area thats why there is progress. Once they are clean they are overpriced and are no longer interesting for the young people so we work on this community right now. You can see it by the huge amount of people in the local biedribas, taking part in events, markets, initiatives etc. Just check the real estate price growth charts from any company and the amount of deals closed to understand the demand (most also have a growth % indicated). This is not klusais centrs, this is a hipsters place, but you statement sound like they come from someone who does not live here, just went through the are and judged based on what they saw on the street that day. Come to some events, go to Kuure, sunbathe in Ziedondarzs, have a burger at OAKa, a beer at krokodils, play some board games at the ezitis down the road and you might just get a little taste of why we young people love it here. Klusais centrs is a place where all the dirty money is parked so of course it is incomparable.  P.S. just to give you the pricing growth understanding - I bought the apartment in 2018 for 58 000 and I am going to sign paperwork to sell it tomorrow for 115 000 (the deposit is already in my hand). And what am I doing with that money? Buying another horrible, destroyed apartment under market value here that is owned by some alcoholics or drug addicts (just 2x bigger than mine), repair it and make it a home. And thats how this process works - one property, one event and one inhabitant at a time :)",2,1721808708.0,2024-07-24 08:11:48

2961,1e7cluu,[deleted],"No public housing there except for a few newly built (around 2010) separate commie block style welfare housing. Those inhabitants often abuse their free flat and surroundings, not unusual to secretly rent it out for money, alcohol is often involved.     The regular commie block house owners are all private persons but often rent them out instead of living there themselves. Those were built to house the massive USSR-backed immigration from USSR states (inclusing Russia) as a plan to establish total dominance and make Latvia a part of Russia by all means (Latvians almost became a minority in own country as a result). Good thing USSR collapsed around 1990 and part of the immigrants went home but many stayed - enough to cause headache still today.    Ethnic Latvians were lower caste and didn't typically receive flats in those Riga commie blocks - it was the Russian-speaking immigrants. So these neighborhoods are heavily Russian-speaking. As these blocks were built in 2nd part of 20th century  up until early 90's, many inhabitants acquired them for quite small money after USSR ceased to exist and later left them as an inheritance to their  kids/grandkids, which do not always want to live there and rent out/sell them, thus having a bit more of Latvians settle those blocks.",2,1721539656.0,2024-07-21 05:27:36
2962,1e7cluu,Tsukutsukuboshi,"Thank you for your answer. After all this years are still separeted Russians a Latvians? I mean during the last 40 years they didn't mixed (marriage, friendship etc)?",1,1721543456.0,2024-07-21 06:30:56
2963,1e7cluu,[deleted],"There are some marriages, friendships and so on but a very big part of Russians (especially the old ones) live in their separate world preferring not to interact with anything Latvian beyond bare necessity. News in Russian (often - straight from Kremlin), newspapers, pro-russian political parties voicing Kremlin narrative, Russian schools where teachers formally have to teach everything in Latvian but in reality only speak broken one themselves when an inspection arrives. That boils down to both attitude and intellectual capabilities, encouraged by meak politics keeping Russian schools and not enforcing any integration.    As I said - Latvians were considered a lower caste, called names and ""fascists"" in USSR due to resisting Russian occupation and objecting Russian atrocities in WW2 and in every dispute anything Russian was right by default, up to the secret service (KGB). That led to the Russians demonstratively calling Latvian as ""language of the dogs"" not worth learning, consequences of which we still see today, also in the aforementioned schools as the parents and grandparents often were the ones exhibiting such attitude. The more progressive, intellectually developed and reasonable part of the Russians send their kids to Latvian schools, they grow up knowing both languages well, integrate well, usually don't repeat Kremlin narrative or cause any trouble. The more stubborn, less intellectually gifted part of the Russians just want to live their life with everything Russia in their daily lives but still enjoying being in Europe. They have a comfortable life with most businesses speaking Russian to them.    TL;DR: we try to get along but there's way too large immigration forced upon Latvia and ingrained propaganda to deal with in one generation. Language learning is a big factor. The young ones are better unless they live in pro-Kremlin families. Speaking just Russian is usually a telltale sign of having pro-Kremlin views and having below average education, thus reducing any chances of mixing.",1,1721550003.0,2024-07-21 08:20:03

What kind of attitude do you expect towards your country and language after this?  My father worked in this country and paid taxes all his life. Now he receives a poverty pension that is only enough for food and bills.  Here's what I say.  Most of the districts, hospitals, schools and clinics in Riga were built by, as you say, ""occupants"". What did native Latvians built in almost 35 years of independence? This is a rhetorical question.  All this time our goverment fuck around with Latvian language and did nothing besides that.  Soviet infrastructure are slowly failing apart. Where will we live? In those overpriced 1-room dog burrows in new buildings?

It's been going downhill for a while the biggest blow sustained was 2008. I don't think they ever fully recovered from it.   Plus there is another big issue, which is not really being addressed and it's causing all these abandoned houses issue you mentioned. In 1991 the law passed where the properties were denationalised and returned to the owners, whom they belonged to in 1940, or their heirs. This resulted in large number of properties with people living in them belonging to people that may have never been to Latvia and all of a sudden became landlords. However as anyone would agree owning something vs maintaining it has a difference. The maintenance costs and restoration costs are super high, so that people that own it may not have the ways and means to repair it. So thus there is this sad view in many parts of the city and since there is no legal way to force owners to repair their properties - you see what you get.",2,1721643004.0,2024-07-22 10:10:04

2970,1e7cluu,ovenbabyh,"1) As someone who has lived in Riga my entire life, I've always felt like the left bank of the river (opposite from downtown), with the exception of ""Klusais centrs"" and Old town is the wealthy side, for example, most of my relatives/friends from my neighbourhood in the suburbs of the right bank, who got married and had kids and found a stable income moved there, to the new/renovated buildings.   2) Every neighbourhood has its suspicious persons and buildings, but the ones that are more noticeable (Kengarags, Maskavas fortstate, Ilguciems, Bolderaja, Zolitude, Imanta, Plavnieki, Purvciems, parts of Jugla and Mezciems, and many many more neighbourhoods) have the lowest rent prices due to the apartment buildings which were built in the 60s-70s-80s for families of factory workers(you couldn't just buy an apartment like that, even if you had the money), and were built to live in for 20 - 30 years max. Most of the landlords are old people, and don't raise the rent prices up to the clouds, that's why they are appealing to criminals and junkies. For example, my grandpa got an apartment in Mezciems in 1980., and after his death 2 years ago, we sold it for a relatively low price. The new owners paid in cash with paper money, think of it what you want.   3) After the collapse of the USSR, there was a huge wave of the so-called ""privatisation"" when all kinds of buildings and factories were bought for a relatively low price. Some original owners still own them, some sold them for a bigger price, and the new owners either don't want or can't afford to do anything with their properties, that's why they are abandoned.",1,1721586762.0,2024-07-21 18:32:42

2976,1e6e9iv,flapcaek,"Ķemeri national park and open air museum are great choices!  If you're looking for things to see in Riga, I would probably suggest the Latvian National Museum of Art which was refurbished recently. And if you're interested in architecture, it borders with a part of the city which has many Art Nouveau buildings in one place.  The old town of Riga might be an interesting place to wander around as well.  If it's the end part of September, give Sigulda a shot. You might get a glimpse of the ""golden autumn"".   If not, that is probably the first suggestion everyone will give you either way, as you can hike on both sides of the river Gauja valley and see some great nature sights + if you go to Turaida, you can visit the castle as well.  If you're going in the direction of Sigulda, Līgatne is another destination you might consider. You can check out [https://www.ligatnesdabastakas.lv/home/](https://www.ligatnesdabastakas.lv/home/) Līgatnes nature trails and the town of Līgatne itself.  Depending on how far from Riga you're willing to go, there are many great nature hiking trails of different difficulties. I would suggest using the map of [dodies.lv](http://dodies.lv) which has listed many trails, however it seems to be only in Latvian so it might be difficult to figure it out.  These are just some suggestions from the top of my head, but you might try posting in r/latvia as it's a larger community than Riga one and you might get more responses there.

2979,1e6e9iv,Sableye09,"Nice. Since your friend is retiring I guessed it was an older crowd, but you never know what people are up to hahah  For history, I'd really recommend checking out the occupation museum, it's a really nice exhibition, with or without a tour. It gives some great insight into recent history and what Latvia had to endure. There's also a lot of things to see around it like the Tris Brali, the Opera House or the Freedom Monument. If you want to go even further back in history, while it's not the best place for that specifically, the Jewish museum is also quite nice and digs a bit deeper. (And while I'm biased for the next one, since I used to work there) The Žanis Lipke museum just across the river is also great, is gorgeously designed and tells a great story. I would recommend a tour for 19 people though.  For physical activities, both of my suggestions are weatherdependent and require a train ride, but if you have the time to take a train out to Sigulda, it's great for a little day trip hike, and also has some interesting sights to see, the sandstone cave in particular is a cool piece of history. If you have the time, check out Jurmala, in my opinion the most gorgeous beach around Riga, and there are some nice places for food around it too.  Ala Pagrabs, Folkklubs is great for a big beer selection and more traditional food, it is a bit dark though. Same goes for Rozengrals, though it has a more medieval touch to it. There are other places too, but let me know if you want to know more, or more about what.   Lived in Riga for 10 months, Sept-June 2023, so these places should still be fine, and I hope they are kind of what you're looking for :)",5,1721328220.0,2024-07-18 18:43:40

3077,1e29p9t,Onetwodash,"These guys [https://www.facebook.com/SALASMAIZEofficial/](https://www.facebook.com/SALASMAIZEofficial/) used to make the only sklandrausis I've ever tried in Riga that was nice, and not an annual reminder of 'oh, right, I hate this'. Whether they're still active, whether their skalndrausis master is still with them - I have no idea. But maybe they reply on facebook or something. Thing is, sklandrausis can be really good. The stuff in Sky and, unless they've changed, also in Kalnciema tirgus is downright awful.  Kuldīga is pretty and quite worth a daytrip.  Other stuff to try:  coldsoup/beetsoup/pinksoup. Honestly any random bistro if that's still august. Might have to rely on Lido by september, it's a summer food. If you're offered potato with it RUN and report Lithuanian occupants at nearest police station.  Potatoes with herring and cottage cheese.  Bukstiņputra - milk based barley porridge with potatoes, eaten with cooked bacon and caramelized onions. MrBobs Bistro @ Čiekurkalns makes a very good one, might not be as good in their  franchise locations. Can be randomly found at other bistros or fancier places.  Maizes zupa - a desert based on rye bread with dried fruits. Eaten with milk and whipped cream.  Smoked fish with cheese (and, optionally -  onions/garlic/bellepepper if you like those). Location - wherever you can get freshest, supermarkets usually have few days old. It's not bad, but it's not as great. Sometimes there are stalls next to the big malls selling fresher stuff. Same in some of the local farmers markets in plenty of places in the city carry fresh stuff few times a week. Or if you drive along seacoast early enough in the morning. There are signs, you'll notice.  Eels in tea jelly - national delicay for when you want to get extra fancy. Search this in the market.  Rīgas šprotes - national tapa for when you do really want jellied eels but you don't like the idea of actually eating eels and would rather have a healthy fatty fish instead.. It's hot smoked sprats in oil, canned (glas jar option also available) that keeps forever until you open the packaging. You put a fish (or 2-3) on a slice of bread and spread it out with a fork. Use bread to soak up oil remaining in a can in the end if you wish.  Open faced sandwiches (that we really should advertise way more, nordics and slavs do, not sure why we don't). Some traditional combos that may be offered in few places  or you can  just buy groceries and make your own - White bread-butter-tomato-salt-pepper-red onions. White bread-butter-lightly salted salmon-salt-onions-dill-lemon. Black bread-butter-soft boiled egg-salted herring.   Sour-cream based salad. 'Rosols' - sometimes renamed to 'Gaļas salāti' or 'cepeša salāti'. It's local version of what Spanish call Insalada russa. 'Siera salāti' - cheese, garlic, carrots, sour cream. 'Valmieras salāti' - cheese, eggs, pickles, mayo, sour cream. 'Siļķe kažokā' aka 'herring in a coat'.  - layers of herring, beetroot, onions and few other ingredients I can't currently remember. It's another pink food.  In few months it's apple time so just get a square of applie pie, 'ābolu plātsmaize'.  And yeah, get speķa pīrādziņi. Also try 'Kārums'.",1,1720974983.0,2024-07-14 16:36:23

I suggest using the small part of it along Anglican church, right between ""Poļu gāte"" and ""Bīskapa gāte"". Same rate but more quiet and parallel parked and less chances of getting your doors dinged.  Third option: if you are not confused by \~5eur/h rate then drive right into Vecrīga and leave on any street where that's not forbidden.  Fourth: there's a big parking lot on Kungu/Peldu street corner. Rate was IIRC 2eur/h, paid in cash.",1,1720020081.0,2024-07-03 15:21:21

So check the map to see what you want to see and then you can find the closest train station name.  For Mobilly - just enter the origin name(Rīga) and destination, buy the ticket, usually one way or you can get it for return too. Tickets are usually for a train for a certain time. It’ll show you the departure times. Then on the train a conductor will ask you for the ticket and you show them the Mobilly QR code you’ll be  given after purchase. Trains to jurmala almost always leave exclusively from platform 3. The destination of the train is on the front carriage(they go to Tukums II or Sloka) and on screens at the platform.  At central station there are signs to the platform for the jurmala train.   Hope this helps!",1,1718623099.0,2024-06-17 11:18:19

Shopping was not that cheap, but food and transport were :)  For spa ESPA was amazing, me and my friend had the two person say spa and loved it  For massage there are several Thai places with really good ratings. Reasonable prices for me at least. Paid 50 euro for 60 min  In general they are reeeeally bad at replying on WhatsApp and Instagram and often never get back to you, so that can be really frustrating. This goes for everything.   Google ""lash"" where you are staying and several places pop up, prices are from 20-50 euro (20 without color, and many places advise you to get the colour anyway or it's not optional).   For hairdressers it's also very difficult to get an appointment.  For teeth I went to sky Dream Clinic and had a very confusing experience (they didn't know the prices of their services, so it was kind of a surprise?), I got a teeth whitening home set for ~300 euro and they said the prices are around the same everywhere.

3395,1c1br3r,Sweet_nSalty,"What ever you do do not apply for the EcOlive or Ventspils Loft apartments by LK group.  The landlord or building administrator is a piece of work. First red flags were these uncomfrotable sexist and racist comments like ""I don't rent for too dark people because they cook stinky foods"" and ""Because you are a woman, if you have any issues like changing a light bulb I will come there. If you were a man I would tell you to change it yourself.""   Later on there were a lot of un-announced visits... The building manager would just knock on the door evening around 21:00 and asked to just check the apartment. These happened frequently. He also gave uncomfrotable pet names for female residents and last drop was when he came to the apartment un-announced with his own keys. Once when I personally were home, and once when I had uni class, but had friend visiting. The friend was enraged that I did not tell them that my landlord was visiting and they were hanging in my flat with just their underwear... So yeah.  After those incidents I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible but had to fight for the deposit. All their contracts are for one year. Apparently it was totally fine for the landlord to break the contract by coming to the apartment whenever he wanted. On the rental agreement there was a paragraph that they can check the apartment but only if they announce it by text or email. They never texted about the visits, so for them to break the contract was fine, but not for me to cut the rental time shorter.",1,1718280630.0,2024-06-13 12:10:30

And in countries without a history of intensive multiculturalism it's a lot more visible and lot more present. You'll see for yourself  that there is alot more casual everyday racism in the countries which used to be under Russian occupation in the times of the Soviet Union.   In Latvia's defence, the people have lived through centuries of struggle, fighting and suffering to keep their culture and language alive - a history like that is always going to lead to a certain cultural protectiveness and even defensiveness. Some people are going to be hostile, that's the reality you'll have to expect. Some people are going make assumptions because you're Indian, like thinking that you're probably sexist or other similar negative stereotypes. This hasn't been helped by the fact that most Latvians experience of Indian people has been via international students who can sometimes be more entitled and less respectful than  other migrants and visitors.  But while Latvians are slow to warm up to strangers, they be can be very generous and welcoming if you make the effort to learn the language and respect the culture. Especially the language part. **The key to belonging in Latvia is learning the fucking language.**  The truth is that most people going to be indifferent to you, or even cold.

I think it costs around 50€ per person but don't qoute me on this. The tours are done by a beer sommelier and they include a personalised tour of 3-4 breweries / taprooms and you get to try 12 different local beers taking in to account your preference and knowledge. I'm not sure you could get a tour on those dates since it's around the holiday's and most places will be shut on the 25th but it's worth giving them a ring.

Book yourself into one of the 5 star hotels in the city , off season and weekday and you can make use of the pool, sauna, steam room, gym, amazing bed / breakfast for a fraction of what it will cost in an expensive city like London.  There are quite a few vintage clothing shops worth browsing and talking to the staff, most are younger people who interact with foreigners.  The weather is getting nicer to take a bus to Sigulda and ride the cable car or take a train to Jurmula and go for a walk on the beach. There are loads of parks / forests in and around the city.  Admire some Soviet architecture and take some cool photographs, post them on social media with tags to Riga. Great way to meet people over a hobby.  I think the hardest thing to do in Riga is making friends / interacting with locals but I’ve actually had success on apps like Couchsurfing where there are more open minded people. btw I don’t live in Riga. My girlfriend does and I visit once a month and have been doing so for the last 2 years.  https://preview.redd.it/yxypd1328ave1.png?width=1534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba7a666c5888ac7556b70f9679ef950770aa5715",3,1744846469.0,2025-04-16 23:34:29

3725,1jz2wxb,Actually_Late,"It's a mix but there are definitely some good options with high quality doctors. For Latvians that usually means that you have to pay more but since you are probably not covered by our social security anyway, it probably doesn't matter.

3727,1jz2wxb,Suspicious-Coconut38,"It is and it isn't good, it depends. You have to use your own critical thinking sometimes :) Here healthcare is not for free(or at least, not 100% of it, there are some procedures/surgeries that are for free if you want to wait, but that is another story), so in some way it is a business.   When in Scandinavia, etc, your family doctor will tell you to take a painkiller and go home(also not great), here the doctor will prescribe you **multiple** medicine and tests. Your choice to buy them or do the tests.  It is very common to have a health insurance as one of the benefits if you will be working, which usually covers quite a lot, so you can go to any private doctors you wish to and have it covered.

If you end up in the state system (e.g. private hospitals have very narrow specializations on elective stuff, for most serious emergencies you’ll end up at a state one), it’s a coin flip.

3732,1jz2wxb,Vladekk,"Balance of quality and price is good. If you are younger/healthier or have less money, Latvian healthcare is not bad at all.   If you have money, there might be countries with better equipment and doctors. Also, if you have rare or complex condition, it might be that Latvia has no expertise for that.  There is no utopia. My sister lives in USA, and recently clinic told her boyfriend the closest date they can do some examination on him is NEXT YEAR.

My Latvian gf and I had a cheap evening flight on our anniversary a year ago from a remote airport in Belgium back to Riga. She absolutely had to make the flight as she had work the next day. We missed our connecting train to the airport and were stuck in the middle of nowhere with no Uber or even a phone number for a local taxi. I asked some local teenagers to call me a taxi and paid 110 euros to get to the airport, flight was delayed and we got to Riga after midnight with no bolt / bus operating and had to use the extortionate taxi drivers outside the airport :) stressful and expensive at the time but memorable and we laugh about it now.   On another occasion we fell asleep in our hotel in Budapest at 3am despite having a 7am flight back to London. We got a taxi who broke all the speed limits and we got to the airport at 6.30am just about boarding the plane.

Decaf there costs extra, but you order what you want, how you want (they use scale to measure espresso perfectly) go and pick it up when ready, no need to even struggle with explaining staff about decaff.    App is called 'COFYZ app me in'.  Best bumble coffee in Riga too. Skip on their coconut milk though.    Another local option Cafeinn may have (if they're not suddenly out...) is chicory coffee.

3812,1jw1om3,Morterius,"As a parent with two kids the same age, depends on your kids :D    If they're patient, some museums would work, like the Museum of History and Navigation, Museum of the History of Natural Sciences and, if you want to scare them, the museum of medicine and anatomics (only if you're a goth family). If they're into cars, the Riga Motor Museum is very good, even though it's not in the center. It's one of the very few ones that's really interactive.    For local cuisine, I would still suggest Lido chain, even though some locals would cringe probably, because it's buffet style and kids can pick whatever they want and you can try unusual things, there's one with a windmill  and kids playground, but it's a bit outside of the center (Lido Krasta), but in the center as well.    Register with bolt taxi if you can (local Uber) , since you're 4, it's better anyways for short trips and not that much more expensive, since you have to buy tickets for 4, it will save you a lot of hassle.    If the weather holds, I would suggest to go to  city of Jurmala by train to see the seaside (Majori station), there's the Jomas street for restaurants and you might be able to dip your toes in the sea, also some beach playgrounds and the ""Jūrmalas Mažaparks"" park with tree climbing activities). There's also an Aquapark in Jurmala (Bulduri station) if your kids are very into swimming and dissapointed if it rains.    It's generally very safe, especially if you're with the kids and don't go to bars looking for trouble.    A common scam is the taxis at the airport, they have to display their tariffs openly, just check if they're not insane and don't follow anyone that offers a taxi. I would take just the salad green Airbaltic taxis at the exit just to be on the safe side.    Other than that, you're set, I hope you will enjoy your time in Latvia! ",13,1744303945.0,2025-04-10 16:52:25

3817,1jw1om3,JournalistShoddy2760," Which dates are you travelling? There's kids and youth song and dance festival happening in Riga around July 5-13 (nacgavilet.lv for more info). So around that time the city might be more crowded with other kids and families.  For rainy days - most shopping malls have some sort of kids activities areas (for a fee though). Check out Skypark in Domina mall. There's also Jump Space in Spice, Adventica in Olympia, and some others. Usually only the kids need to buy the hourly or daily pass and parents can just sit and relax on the side.   If you find it difficult to fill all the 6 days in Riga, you might consider a day trip or even an overnight stay at some other city. Ventspils - a coastal city around 2.5h drive from Riga - has a nice science centre Zinooo, there's also a kids park/playground area in the city, indoor and outdoor pools/slides (udensparks.lv and pludmalesakvaparks.lv). Cesis has a cool older castle and is generally a nice city (can be reached by train as well).",1,1744447534.0,2025-04-12 08:45:34

And nights weren’t cold, being near the sea.  I didn’t know much and chose a newer apartment in Āgenskalns, across the river from Centrs and the old town. It was extremely peaceful, very green and mostly residential with pretty wooden houses and gardens.   I prefer to walk rather than take public transport, so walking to Centrs was around 40 minutes. By tram or bus it was 15-20 min. I ended up not going there much, so I feel I missed a bit being in the city itself.   My apartment was more than ok for me, working remotely, with very good internet for my video calls, and I paid 750 euros/month on Airbnb.  I enjoyed my summer in Latvia, but for me it was mostly getting out of the city, exploring other towns and a bit of the Baltic. Forest walks, the never ending beach and the countryside.

For a few months Airbnb might still be your best choice, though. Be upfront about bringing a dog.   Before choosing the part of the city where you want to live, consider your priorities. The city centre is very walkable and you'll be close to many bars and restaurants, but some streets might be loud with outdoor terraces for restaurants etc. There are some parks in the city centre, but there are other parts of the city with forests near/in them which might be great for your dog.

Inside the box is where I'd stay.  I can't be more specific because I don't live in Riga and I don't know what your interests are specifically.

3851,1js7ha8,kristapszs,"Summers are awesome in Latvia, your clothing will be fine. Considering that you have dog, i would avoid center, simply because there is almost no greenery (atleast considering my standarts) I always feel sorry for the dogs who need to do their business on the pavement. And center  gets too hot in the summers. I know that USA hot places air conditioning is a basic feature, but here air conditioning is a luxury in apartaments and only few has it, so consider it as well. Also air quality is not the best in center. I would suggest more greener palces like Mezciems (it has Bikernieku mezs next to it, best place for walks) or Mezaparks (if ur budget allows it, mezaparks is expensive and argubly the fanciest neigborhood of Riga, but avoid Sarkandaugava which is next to it) ,  those are a bit further away from center but still well connected.  Then its Grizinkalns, Skanste (also on expensive side) or Teika. I have bias about right side of Daugava and i think its way better than the left side of Daugava river(with exception of Agenskalns), but otherwise , right side is more developed and more things to do, with more parties/events, better food etc. with better opportunities outside the city as well.  Riga has a train connections to both sides of the sea (Jurmala on one side, and Saulkrasti on the other). Also visit Gaujas National Park (another + for right side of Daugava river).

It did take a while, but was well worth the wait. Also, because we were so patient, we ended up with a free drink and free desert. The service was fantastic at both.  But what else are you looking for?  [Riviera](http://rivierarestorans.lv/en/) was also really good, as was [FERMA](https://fermarestorans.lv/lv/).    Theres a LOT of good, inexpensive food too.

IT industry is not particularly developed, there are companies, but it's nowhere near what you'll find in Estonia. You'd be better off staying in the UK, and work remote for a US company.

4071,15jghyl,avatarname,"This is what puzzles me too, in Stockholm you can find Asian buffet type of places everywhere and on weekdays it costs maybe from as low as 13 euros... (our ''pusdienu piedavajums'' type) and Saturdays/Sundays price will go to 20-25 euros and upwards. I am not talking about places in fancy locations here. But in Riga when you look at brunch options, you will see 30 euros + and such, what gives? Prices are indeed extreme. I understand we have a lot of fucktards here who will treat ''all you can eat'' as ''all you can eat whole day and also stuff in the bag'' etc. but it is also not like Stockholm too is full of wonderfully mannered people today, there are a lot of immigrants from similar cultural background to our defective ''homo sovieticus'', but still they manage. If we had such places for say 16 euros I would go there from time to time, but we seem to have just brunch places for over 25 euros... And I think 16 euro price would scare away any of such fucktards that destroy the place. But sine such do not exist, maybe they have calculated that only 25 euros + scare away the crowd that would abuse all you can eat? And only at that price it makes sense here either because there are not that many people who want this and/or otherwise they would have a lot of people who not just eat shit-ton but also steal",1,1712907816.0,2024-04-12 07:43:36

4148,14xxym8,The_Lettonian,"Flew out of Riga recently on a 7am flight and and the non-priority line for checking in and checking bags was quite long. The check-in desks opened at 5am so there was an immediate line at security once that started flowing, even the security line itself wasn't too long. You *might* be able to make it work with the bus if you have a priority boarding/security and/or no checked bags but there'll be a line at security already....honestly I'd say just take the bolt if you have any checked luggage and/or want to be safe.   For me, I didn't have priority boarding but made it to my plane with a bit of stress but without running, and I got to the airport before 5. I was still in line to check in at 6 and would have missed my flight if it was that early.",1,1689196708.0,2023-07-12 21:18:28

Lufthansa, my airline, has zero line. Security said estimate ""1 minute"".  I went to the priority line but this actually took longer as the lady wanted to see my frequent flyer card so I had to find it in my app since no one has ever asked for it.  The guy in front of me got offended that the agent asked him to show down as he was forcing his trays through the xray and made a big scene asking for a manager to complain further.  I stopped by the lounge and got there at 5:25. So the bus probably would have been fine assuming it was on time and the conditions didn't change.

4223,142t25r,Infamous_Ad1317,"Greetings!  Welcome!  Here are some helpful tips and suggestions for your stay in Riga:  1. Upon your arrival at the airport, consider booking a 'Bolt' taxi instead of a regular one to avoid any potential overcharging. You can download the 'Bolt' app, which also offers the option to pre-book your ride.  2. Latvians are generally friendly, although they tend to be more reserved. However, the younger generation is more relaxed and outgoing.  3. When it comes to grocery shopping, Rimi, Maxima, or Lidl are all good options with reasonable prices.  4. Riga is generally a safe city. However, it's advisable to avoid the square outside 'Orego Mall' and Riga Central Station, as there tends to be a high number of intoxicated individuals in those areas.  5. The weather in Riga is similar to that of Scandinavian countries. Summers are short, and winters can be extremely cold. Personally, I find the weather enjoyable here.  6. If you're looking for an apartment to rent, many people use 'www.ss.lv' as a popular platform. You can also explore Facebook Marketplace for additional options.  7. For sightseeing and exploring the city, I recommend using Google Maps. It will provide you with a wealth of information about various places of interest.  8. During peak rush hour, crossing the bridge by car or bus can take approximately 15-20 minutes. However, if you opt for a tram or one of the many electric scooters available (such as Bolt or Tulu), the journey will likely only take 2-3 minutes.  9. Lastly, I advise you to immerse yourself in the local culture, make new friends, enjoy your time in this beautiful city, and, of course, study hard.  Wishing you all the best during your stay! 😊",4,1686091439.0,2023-06-06 22:43:59
4224,13pycs6,yung_lank,"Food: Ala Folkklubs, Lido Places in Riga: Old Riga (but food is wayyyy overpriced, and you probably planned if already), City Centrs (a couple cute parks, cheaper food, art nouveau capital of the world), Mežaparks is a good introduction to Latvian nature (the top of the iceberg), and has some pretty views, and a zoo, Centralitirgus (central markets in giant old zeppelin hangars, sorta cool, but they are a lot of drunks around there so just ignore them if / when they talk to u)  If you have time consider a day trip to Cesis or Sigulda for their castles Jurmala is a good tourist spot, but better beaches (with much much less food / shops/ etc) would be Vacaķi vai Saulkrasti)",4,1684884001.0,2023-05-23 23:20:01
4225,13pycs6,WhoStoleMyPassport,"If the temperature and weather is good take a train to Jūrmala (Majori station), Sigulda or Cēsīs.  Jūrmala: Has a full street with just restaurants and a beautiful white sand beach just 10-15 minutes walking distance from the train station. Ticket prices just under 2€ per person one direction just 1 hour outside Riga.   Cēsis: Lovely town with a old medieval center and a large medieval castle very immersive experience. Cool cafes and restaurants around and a national park around the city. Trains ticket price 3.50€ per person. 2 hours outside Riga.   Sigulda: Nice small town on the edge of a national park. You can ride down a Olympic bobsleigh, visit 2 castle ruins 1 inside the town and 1 outside (a bit of a hike through the national park) and amazing views. It also has a cool market with restaurants called ""Jāņa tirgus""  Ticket price just under 2€ for the train.   Rundālē Palace aka Versailles of the North is a nickname that is has held for a looong time. It's a very beautiful Palace with the most beautiful French garden. You can get there by taking public transport like a bus. Or a tour bus, but naturally thst costs more.   If you wish to do one of these then I recommend you download Mobilly or Pasažieru Vilciens app to see all train time tables and to purchase tickets. (It's cheaper online.)  About restaurants in Riga... Someone already made a good list, but I can also recommend:   Kūkotava they have nice pastries, salads, snacks etc. (Don't be confised that the place is split in two)  Mīkla: Good coffee, amazing pastries and sandwiches.  Boo the burger: Amazing juicy burgers! And they literally serve champagne with each burger. 😭  Street Burger: Amazing juicy burgers.  Shōyu: Japanese restaurant that literally has 96% 5 star votes! The food is gorgeous and just fenomenal... The prices are higher though. For example a large noodle bowl is 14-18€  These restaurants that I listed are very trendy.  As for places to visit in Riga...  Of course the old town.  City centre and the ""Quiet centre"".  Alot of cool buildings you can enter in Riga old town... Too many to list, but I recommend you get maps at the tourism information office.  Open air museum if you want to see how Latvians lived in each region of the country for hundreds of years. (They literally transported real buildings into one area. It is also the 2nd oldest ethnographic open-air museum in the world.)  Central market.  Railway museum if youre into old trains.

I stayed in Riga for 4 weeks last year and I never heard about any scams like that going on, but that's not saying it doesn't happen.  2.) You could ask someone that works with tourists/visitors for more info - like someone that works at a hostel. They would likely know more.  3.) If you meet her, you could always suggest going to a different place for drinks. Plenty of places to choose from in Riga. For a first date, something easy and public is always a good idea.     And as always, trust your instincts. Anything too good to be true usually is. Last year when I was in Riga, someone I met at a bar one night started being a little too friendly and buying me shots and drinks. It felt like it might be some kind of scam so I just left.

4337,12t332e,Unlikely_Author_607,"Hey there! Navigating the rental market in Riga can indeed be a bit tricky, especially for a shorter stay like 8 months. Sorry to hear about the bad advice from your institution.   Local Websites: Start with ss.com and City24.lv. They're quite popular for rentals in Riga and offer a variety of options. Just remember to filter for short-term rentals.   Facebook Groups: Check out groups like Riga Apartments/Houses for Rent and Sale. While it's always good to be cautious (especially in groups where anyone can post), you can often find good leads. Pay attention to posts from verified agents for more security.   Pinecone Property Group: If you're looking for something more tailored to international students, Pinecone Property Group might be a good option. They're known for helping students and expats find suitable accommodations in Riga and might have options that align with your 8-month stay.   University Networks: Sometimes other students or university boards can have leads on available rentals. It's worth checking out any online forums or networks related to your institution.   Remember to always check the terms of the lease, especially for the duration of your stay, and if possible, have a local or someone familiar with the Latvian rental market review any contracts before you sign. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your time in Riga!",1,1705334701.0,2024-01-15 16:05:01

4462,10b814j,yung_lank,Hey! I’ve worked a lot in Riga as someone originally from America feel free to shoot me a dm and I can give u more specifics. I’m a Latvian citizen tho so won’t be able to help with the visa part :(.,1,1673663881.0,2023-01-14 02:38:01
4463,10a5y11,santajana2013,I would say March is still a winter month. At least for me.  I suggest to visit Open air museum if the weather is ok.,6,1673554461.0,2023-01-12 20:14:21
4464,10a5y11,noturi,"Hello! First of all, Riga in march is very unpredictabe. There could be snow or there could be sunny, semi-warm spring weather, so prepare yourself for anything. Old town is beautiful by itself, but there are many tourist-trap places, so i would suggest taking a walk through it, in the evening go to the St.Peters Church and enjoy the view from the tower (open till 22:00). As i dont know what kind of a vibe you are looking for, im going to suggest different kinds. Che, Laska, Aleponija, Auss, Taka would be kind of alternative spots to have a drink and hang out. If you want some craft beer, then go to Labietis, Nurme, Trofeja, Miezis un kompānija. Sidrērija, Biedrība, M/Darbnīca are the spots for live music events. Visit Āgenskalna tirgus second floor to have some lunch - there is nice food court. If you want a party on a weekend with DJs, drinks, good vibes, people in their 30s and food go to Space Falafel, Manana, Herbārijs, B Bar or Zefīrs. General coctails, food and talking - one of This Place Doesnt Need a Name locations, Bāka, Snatch or RIONE (all of these places probably need a reservation beforehand). Really nice speakeasy bar is no saints (in front of italian embassy). If you want some fancy restaurant with amazing food and cocktails (these are going to be a bit pricey) JOHN, Barents, Whitehouse, COD, Tails. If you are looking for really good fast/street food, then enjoy Boar BBQ (this place is right nezt door to Nurme craft beer bar), OAK, Boo the burger, Kingu kebab. I know that suggesting museums some may consider lame, but i reeeeally suggest you to go and see Anatomy Museum - its newly renovated, really cool interactive stuff, basment floor is just mind blowing. If you dont have strong nerves, then consider maybe not going :D https://www.liveriga.com/en/11030-the-rsu-anatomy-museum/  But riga has cool Motormuseum as well: https://www.liveriga.com/en/1160-riga-motor-museum/",4,1673623229.0,2023-01-13 15:20:29
4465,10a5y11,throbhuij,Wow! This is wonderful advice. Thank you for your help and generosity :) I’m excited to visit Riga if the people there are as nice as the people in this sub ❤️,4,1673625090.0,2023-01-13 15:51:30
4466,10a5y11,traktoriste,"-""Ala"" for traditional Latvian food (big portions, folk music in background but I suggest reservation.  - Another one that has a nice hobbit, medieval atmosphere would be ""Lāsīte"". They sometimes have live medieval bands! Pumpkin soup is a must from that place. - For cheap Latvian food ""Lido"" and ""Lidojošā varde"" -For fish restaurant: ""Zivju lete"" - Bakery and coffee - ""Kūkotava"" on Terbates street 10/12. Fancy classical cakes. Place for fancy grandmas who drink champagne with coffee and romantic dates. -For wine ""Vīna studija"". They have nice food plates that you can pair with suggested wines. Usually busy on weekends. Reservation is suggested. - For beer, try ""Miezis"" or ""Labietis"" Latvian craft brewery. - For partying: most Latvians go to two bar and club districts nowadays. Those are full of different bars, breweries, concerts, and usually many people on weekends. Nice and easy way how to spend a night out. Usually no enterance fees. One is called ""Tallinas pagalms"" another one's location is ""Valdemāras Pasāža""",4,1673604850.0,2023-01-13 10:14:10

4468,10a5y11,traktoriste,"Thank you! Glad if it helps.   Another place that came to my mind is ""Two More Beers"" in the Old Town. It's touristic but the service, food, snacks and beer choice is so good that I'm willing to pay a bit extra.  For nice overview on the city, I suggest taking a ""Radisson"" hotel elevator to the top floor. Don't be amused to do it as it's generally something everyone does.  And for things outside Riga but still very easily accessible I would go in to total ""yolo"" mode and try bobsleigh on the real track. The track is open till 13th of March, so maybe you can manage! This city is less than hour away (and is nice itself for a half day trip) and has one of the best bobsleigh and luge tracks in the region. This experience is very unique: https://tourism.sigulda.lv/en/objects/what-to-do/active-holiday/adrenaline-and-sport/bobsleigh-and-luge-track-sigulda/",1,1673609494.0,2023-01-13 11:31:34
4469,10a5y11,davebeastly,"**Trains and Buses** in Latvia are cheap so don't limit yourself to Old Town you can go out of Riga or to places in the suburbs for little money. You can buy bus e-tickets at a shop called Narvesen it's cheaper than buying from the bus driver. Trains are priced by zone but it's cheap forexample to go to the beach which is 30 mins from Riga (Riga - Majori) is €1.43. The cheapest taxi company is probably Panda +37127228880 or you can also use the Bolt app to request a ride.    If you do choose to go out of the city like to the beach or to some other interesting spots let me know and I'll give you some options. Here's some stuff in Riga though:   **Riga Motor Museum** is in the suburbs so you'll need bus number 15 to Jugla.   **St Peter's Church** go up the spire of this church in Old Town for a panoramic view of the city and river.   **Latvian War Museum** is spread over 5 floors in old town and is free, bare in mind most museums close on Mondays so they can open Sunday.   **Ala Pagrabs** is a decent bar that does good food. Try a jug of Brenguļu alus (ale) and ķiploku grauzdiņi (Latvia garlic bread).   **LIDO Atpūtas centrs** is a huge canteen style restaurant and bar that does every Latvian dish imaginable which due to it being a canteen style you can see exactly what you're getting. Their potato fries are particularly moreish also they brew their own beer which is decent and comes in a steins.   **Skyline bar** is a generic fancy hotel bar, but the view from the 23rd floor is one of the best in Riga also free peanuts.   **Events**, You can check this site for events happening around March: [https://www.liveriga.com/en/](https://www.liveriga.com/en/)     **Lastly some random advice:** Most people in their 40s or younger can speak English, so don't be afraid to speak or ask a stranger for help. They will probably be more helpful if you attempt to address them in Lativan though, so here's some basics:  Sveiki (svay-ki) means hello. Lūdzu (Lood-zu) means ""please"" and ""you're welcome"". Paldies (Pal-di-es) means ""thanks"". atā (a-tah) means ""bye"". You can just say sorry in English though as the Latvian word for that is pretty difficult to pronounce. In terms of ordering food from a menu or reading signs the language is pronounced as it is spelled: ""a"" is just ""a, not ""ae"" i.e. there's no multiple sounds for one letter like in English. ""c"" is a ""ts"" sound and ""j"" is ""y"".  Don't be offended if you don't always get a ""please"" and ""thank you"" or ""how are you?"", ""how's your food?"" from the cashiers or wait staff like in the UK, those Americanisms are not so common here yet.  Oh and there will probably be a guy in Old Riga at somepoint trying to get you to go to Victory Pub he might tell you it's a British Pub, but it's actaully a low-key strip club.",2,1674219681.0,2023-01-20 13:01:21

Unfortunately I don't have a good answer to this question. Once in a while there's a more specific exhibition dedicated to this topic, but I haven't heard of anything recently. Our pagan traditions are still intertwined with more modern ones, though. For example, the way we celebrate Easter is mostly pagan.  You might find the Open Air Museum on the outskirts of Riga interesting. The buildings there are just a couple hundred years old, but people's lifestyles back then definitely included many pagan aspects and beliefs. They sometimes host events that are based on our folk traditions, especially around equinoxes and solstices.  If my memory serves me well then the exhibitions at Turaida Castle (outside Riga, but a good day trip) also include quite a bit of information about our early history.

Furthermore, over time, half a Europe has been here claiming ownership (Swedes, Poles, Russians, but Germans most of the time) and adding something to the urban landscape. Each time, the new ""owner"" just added something in their own image. On top of that, as the city grows, incorporating surrounding villages existing ""street plan"" also was included. And again, as the next governance comes, they just built on top that was already there. As for the soviet times, they mostly added living blocks (blocky, creepy looking buildings) closer to the outskirts of modern Riga. Well, basically, everything that looks like that was built in that time.  As for the central part of the city, they made worse already unnatural looking street plan, by adding new building in between what was already there and changing the significance of the road. So previously, small, innocent, walkable street/road became driveway.   In the end, 8 centuries and many builders were needed to give you experience that you had.",2,1741962845.0,2025-03-14 14:34:05

Of course there are many who dress nicely and do bad stuff, but realistically no one here who looks like homeless would be just misunderstood hipster millionaire Balenciaga fan.

But I'm not saying you should like the picture, that's a different story.  I stayed three months in Riga, and I barely interacted with people there—my bad because I can't connect with people easily—but one thing I didn't like about Latvia was this thing I perceived, the hatred towards anything not Latvian. And I get it in part because of their history, but I found it a contradiction with the way everything appeared to be so 'peaceful', for the lack of a better word. Latvians didn't seem to be over emotional or outright rude as I experience in other European countries.  A big part of Riga was built during the Russian Empire era at the turn of the 20th century. All that amazing architecture in Centrs for example. But it doesn't mean you can't keep it as your own, if you feel it's your city (and many of the architects were Latvian). Anyway, my two cents.

Because an international kindergarten or school is like at least 1500€ per month. And as a non local you wouldn’t bring most likely any furniture or other things (child toys, bicycles, skis, car), so there is quite large investments on that side. So I would say the result would be good decent upper middle class life, with like 1 major tourism trip per year.  Quiet center (klusais centrs) is great with a child, there are like 3 great parks with children play zones, everything is in walking distance, no need for a car.

Even so, I'd argue Budapest and _maybe_ Prague have almost perfect connections - even excluding metro - and accessibility. I've been to Budapest like four times and the ease of use is such a joy always. Although that is my personal opinion. I detested public transport in many Polish cities as a tourist due to lack of English and ease of use. Although it's definitely getting better there as they are implementing combined e-tickets throughout the country. Italy and Greece on the other hand was not a lot of fun time to take a bus. You could may as well not look on the timetables at all. Although I haven't been to many cities there, so it may depend on the region.  You compiled a list, yet didn't say what is it you consider good or bad? You're just making angry noise. That's why you're getting downwoted.  For the sake of discussion, I feel Riga is way better than Vilnius in terms of public transport and car infrastructure. Tallinn I haven't used really so can't say though. I'm sure it's also good. Riga is relatively accessible without a car  nowadays, and you _can_ travel mostly from everywhere to everywhere. Prices are not cheap but they are not really expensive comparatively also. The 90minute ticket is really good price per value in my opinion. I've heard they're planning to combine train into a standard ticket as well which is great. You mostly can rely on the timetables.

5113,1ii6hbk,specialistsA,"Worked as a Bolt and Wolt courier for around 2-3 years. Local Latvian.  All foreigners are applying to a courier job as its the easiest and most popular option. Nothing to do with racism or standing above. Here unfortunately we dont have massive warehousing's, production sites or any other simple labor work. We have but in limited options and usually they are filled up already + the international and regional crisis/stagnation etc. A lot of force major situations here and I cant give you one answer. But in general the local market is slowly opening up for foreigners. The barrier is the language and employer preferences.  ok, now about courier jobs - in Wolt they are paid decent, you get above minimum 2.50EUR+ for orders and a lot of regular customer ordering from the app usually. I had few customers ordering regularly. Wolt is also better in caring about their employee (show your attitude and Wolt will appreciate it and give decent support with order issues etc.) Bikes receiver the least amount of orders, because ordering algorithm prioritizes cars (big orders, super markets etc). + the competition for order picking. The golden ages were Covid times - I used to start to work after 5PM and until 10PM or Midnight (depending on the restrictions) I would get a minimum of 50 EUR for min 4 hours work. Now you wont see this kind of tips and delivery earnings. Above it, job its self is really challenging - weather conditions, long hours, roads, traffic, accidents and usually - lack of orders.  And speaking of Bolt - complete opposite attitude, lack of orders, weird cash ordering system and lets say not the best environment comparing to Wolt.  And last but not least - the taxes + social security payments. If your order from Bolt is typically 1.80 EUR, then after all taxes, you will receive just 1.26 EUR. If you do the math, thats not a lot for this hustle. If you do it officially which I did. It also depends on your employee status (self-employed, small company etc)  So this would be my perspective and you could see a lot of Latvians delivering with cars, rather than like me on a bike.

The house is not included in the ""grausts saraksts"" (ruin list), which is a list of houses in Riga that are in unsatisfactorily condition, which is, obviously good. It also has, as far as I see on google maps, a renovated facade. It is  common practice to restore the facade last, which means that, probably, there is nothing wrong on the inside (communications, attic, basement e.t.c.). Ask for the previous utility bill. Check whether there are any positions like ""restoration fund"", and if there is, ask what is it for.   The utility bill is being issued by the service company. Check the reviews for the company online. While on site, check the sound isolation (whether you can hear the neighbours), check the water pressure and how fast the water heats. Also, just have a walk by the building at evening time and check how occupied is the building. For pre-war houses, obviously, the more people - the better, since you don't want a half abandoned old house.   The neighbourhood is nice. Old town is about 15 minutes away, the street is quite in this part and green.   Don't expect it to be ""the centre"" though. No bankers and diplomats in this area. But it is a very perspective neighbourhood thanks to its historical heritage and proximity to centre. I would say it will get better and the prices will rise. I would consider purchasing apartment there, but of course, all depends on the details and whether or not the price is adequate.",4,1738506480.0,2025-02-02 14:28:00

And it was done just because of potential increase of tax.   So yes, better check of water/waste tubes are replaced, electricity, etc. critical infrastructure. And expect that older houses soon will require more investments...  What else could be weakest part in 1910 year built house - pre-war houses have wooden planks between floors (no idea how it is English ""starpstāvu pārsegumi"" :) ), so if its regularly wet, could be very expensive to replace.

5167,1ifxmra,Spiritual-Jello-9970,"It just probably means that there were no other renovations required. Because a lot of inner works - attic, basement, and even communications - can potentially damage the facade, require removal of some parts or just be plain out messy.    It's just illogical to start with the facade. Not saying it can't be done- no law against it. Its just like when renovating you own apartment you for some reason decide to start with cosmetics - paint the walls, put up ceiling and new lights, knowing full well that the electrical wiring is bad and you will need to deal with it in a few years.

Even if it's not particularly romantic, if you have good memories, it will be special for both of you.    You could go somewhere with a nice view of the city, like the wheel, St Peter's church, Academy of Science, Skyline bar in Radisson maybe?    Pretty much anywhere in the old town is very beautiful too, the narrow cobblestone streets are fairly charming. Or maybe walk along the river and do it there.    You could also go outside of Riga, such as the seaside or walk about in nature if that's your wibe. Latvian woods are very peaceful.

5311,1i5s13v,xdox123,Someone already wrote that whole Latvia more or less seems depressive. This dark winter weather and people's tendency to wear dark clothes only adds to such impression.  People get tired at work and in general doesn't do small chitchat. I have seen enough posts where tourists wonder if latvians are rude to them because they don't do small talk and smile. But from other side why it's better in other countries? People there mostly do fake smiles although they probably hate their job. We just might be more realistic and try to preserve more mental strength. I actually prefer that others don't bother me with fake smiles and excessive talking. So it's fine with me that sellers mind their own business. Other than that most people tend to be friendly and kind if you know them closer. Just be polite in general even if there aren't that much smiling and talking.  Central market also tends to attract homeless people and people with addictions. Although there is security such people still are somewhere around there. Similar as in any other country.  Sellers in markets usually are old because that is hard work with low salary. Especially if they need to stand everyday outside in cold it does damage to health. Young people will try to seek easier and better paid work with more perspectives for future. Also not worth for young person to potentially damage health if selling happens in middle of street or not that well heated buildings. It's hard for older people to find job and they don't really expect future promotions so they can agree to such job. Many of those business owners aren't that rich either to find only good looking young workers.  If you can then try fair markets. Usually people are more cheerful there and also there is music. For example Jāņu midsummer market in Vecrīga. There might be some fair markets also for Easter. Usually sellers over there are owners of their small business and doesn't sell that often there for they can put more energy in selling.,4,1737399790.0,2025-01-20 19:03:10
